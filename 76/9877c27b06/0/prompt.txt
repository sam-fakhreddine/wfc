# WFC:PR-COMMENTS - Intelligent PR Comment Triage & Fix

**Fetch, triage, fix.** Automates addressing PR review comments from humans, Copilot, CodeRabbit, and other reviewers.

## What It Does

1. **Fetch** all PR comments via `gh` CLI
2. **Triage** each comment against 5 validity criteria
3. **Present** triage summary to user for approval
4. **Fix** valid comments in parallel (subagents by category)
5. **Commit & push** fixes to the PR branch

## Usage

```bash
# Auto-detect PR from current branch
/wfc-pr-comments

# Specific PR number
/wfc-pr-comments 42

# PR URL
/wfc-pr-comments https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42
```

---

## Workflow

Follow these steps exactly in order.

### Step 1: DETECT PR

Determine which PR to work on:

1. If the user provided a PR number or URL as argument, use that.
2. Otherwise, auto-detect from the current branch:

```bash
gh pr view --json number,url,headRefName,baseRefName,title
```

If no PR is found, tell the user and stop.

Display: `PR #N: <title> (<head> -> <base>)`

### Step 2: FETCH UNRESOLVED COMMENTS

Fetch only **unresolved** review comments from the PR. Use GraphQL — the REST API does not expose thread resolution status.

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $number: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      pullRequest(number: $number) {
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          nodes {
            isResolved
            isOutdated
            path
            line
            startLine
            diffSide
            comments(first: 50) {
              nodes {
                id
                body
                author { login }
                createdAt
                path
                diffHunk
                originalLine
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
' -f owner='{owner}' -f repo='{repo}' -F number={number}
```

**Filter:** Only process threads where `isResolved` is `false`. Skip all resolved threads entirely — they have already been addressed.

Optionally also skip threads where `isOutdated` is `true` (the code has changed since the comment was made), but flag these to the user in the triage table.

Extract from each unresolved thread's first comment:
- `id` — unique identifier
- `author.login` — who wrote it
- `body` — comment text
- `path` — file being commented on
- `line` / `originalLine` — line number
- `diffHunk` — surrounding diff context
- `createdAt` — timestamp

**Deduplication:** If two threads reference the same file + line + substantially identical message, treat them as one.

**Group by file** for display purposes.

If there are zero unresolved comments, tell the user "All review threads are resolved" and stop.

### Step 3: TRIAGE

This is the core intelligence. For each comment, evaluate 5 dimensions and assign a verdict.

**Read each file being commented on** before evaluating (use the Read tool).

#### Dimension 1: ARCHITECTURAL VALIDITY

Does this suggestion align with project patterns?
- Check existing conventions in the file and codebase
- Consider CLAUDE.md / PLANNING.md rules
- A suggestion that contradicts project conventions → lean toward SKIP

#### Dimension 2: SCOPE CHECK

Is this about code in this PR's diff, or asking for unrelated work?
- Comment about code changed in this PR → in scope
- Request for unrelated refactoring → out of scope → SKIP
- Feature request disguised as review comment → SKIP

#### Dimension 3: CORRECTNESS

Is the suggested fix actually correct?
- Would implementing it introduce bugs?
- Does it handle edge cases the reviewer may have missed?
- Is the reviewer wrong about the issue? If so → SKIP with explanation

#### Dimension 4: SEVERITY

- **Critical** (security, data loss, crashes) → always FIX
- **High** (bugs, logic errors) → FIX
- **Medium** (code quality, patterns) → FIX if valid
- **Low** (style, preferences) → FIX if trivial, SKIP if opinionated
- **Info** (questions, suggestions) → RESPOND only

#### Dimension 5: EFFORT vs VALUE

- **Trivial** (1-2 lines) → always FIX
- **Medium** (function-level) → FIX if high value
- **Large** (multi-file refactor) → SKIP, suggest follow-up issue

**Verdict per comment:** `FIX` | `SKIP (reason)` | `RESPOND (reply only)`

### Step 4: PRESENT TRIAGE TO USER

Display a markdown table summarizing the triage:

```
| # | File | Comment (summary) | Verdict | Reason |
|---|------|-------------------|---------|--------|
| 1 | security_hook.py:45 | Add lru_cache to pattern loading | FIX | Valid perf improvement, trivial |
| 2 | orchestrator.py:120 | Rewrite auth flow | SKIP | Out of scope for this PR |
| 3 | README.md:8 | Fix typo "teh" → "the" | FIX | Trivial |
| 4 | consensus.py:30 | Why not use dataclass? | RESPOND | Question, not actionable |
```

Then show summary counts:

```
Summary: 8 FIX, 2 SKIP, 1 RESPOND

Proceed with fixes?
```

**Use AskUserQuestion** to get approval. The user may:
- Approve as-is
- Override specific verdicts (e.g., "skip #1, fix #4")
- Cancel entirely

Apply any user overrides before proceeding.

### Step 5: CATEGORIZE & DELEGATE

Group all `FIX` comments into categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Lint** | Unused imports, formatting, naming conventions |
| **Code Quality** | Caching, error handling, type safety, simplification |
| **Design** | Architecture changes, API modifications, patterns |
| **Docs** | Typos, missing docs, outdated comments |
| **Security** | Vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, input validation |

Spawn **1 subagent per category** via the Task tool (run in parallel).

Each subagent receives this prompt:

```
You are fixing PR review comments in category: {category}

PR: #{number} on branch {headRefName}
Repository root: {repo_root}

Comments to address:
{for each comment in this category:}
---
File: {path}:{line}
Comment by {author}: {body}
Diff context:
{diff_hunk}
---
{end for}

Instructions:
1. Read each file mentioned above
2. Apply the fix described in each comment
3. Verify the fix is correct — do not introduce regressions
4. Run relevant tests if they exist (use: uv run pytest {test_file} -v)
5. Do NOT fix anything not in the comment list above
6. Do NOT make unrelated improvements or refactors
```

For `RESPOND` comments: Do NOT spawn a subagent. Instead, after fixes are committed, use `gh api` to reply to the comment on GitHub with an explanation.

### Step 6: COMMIT & PUSH

After all fix subagents complete:

1. Check which files were modified: `git status`
2. Stage all fixed files (by name, not `git add -A`)
3. Create a single commit:

```
fix: address N PR review comments

- {file1}: {brief description of fix}
- {file2}: {brief description of fix}
...

Addresses comments on PR #{number}

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

4. Push to the PR branch:

```bash
git push origin {headRefName}
```

### Step 7: REPORT

Display a final summary:

```
## PR Comment Fixes Complete

**PR:** #{number} — {title}
**Branch:** {headRefName}

### Fixed (N comments)
- {file}:{line} — {brief fix description}
- ...

### Skipped (N comments)
- {file}:{line} — {reason}
- ...

### Responded (N comments)
- {file}:{line} — {reply summary}
- ...

Pushed to {headRefName}. PR updated.
```

## Integration with WFC

### Fits After
- `wfc-build` or `wfc-implement` (which create PRs)
- Any workflow that pushes a branch and creates a PR

### Complements
- `wfc-review` — internal review BEFORE creating a PR
- `wfc-pr-comments` — external feedback AFTER PR is created

### Typical Flow
```
wfc-build → Push PR → Reviewers comment → /wfc-pr-comments → Push fixes → Merge
```

## Philosophy

**ELEGANT:** Single skill replaces manual comment-by-comment triage
**PARALLEL:** Fix subagents run concurrently by category
**TOKEN-AWARE:** Only reads files that have comments, not the entire codebase
**SAFE:** User approval gate before any fixes are applied

# WFC:CONSENSUS-REVIEW - Five-Agent Consensus Code Review

Five fixed reviewers analyze code and a Consensus Score determines the decision.

## What It Does

1. **Security Reviewer** - Injection, auth/authz, OWASP Top 10
2. **Correctness Reviewer** - Logic bugs, edge cases, type safety
3. **Performance Reviewer** - Algorithmic efficiency, N+1 queries, memory
4. **Maintainability Reviewer** - Readability, naming, SOLID/DRY, complexity
5. **Reliability Reviewer** - Error handling, fault tolerance, graceful degradation
6. **Consensus Score (CS)** - Weighted formula with Minority Protection Rule

## Usage

```bash
# Review specific task
/wfc-consensus-review TASK-001

# Review files directly
/wfc-consensus-review path/to/code

# With properties
/wfc-consensus-review TASK-001 --properties PROP-001,PROP-002
```

## Two-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Prepare Review
```
orchestrator.prepare_review(request) -> 5 task specs
```
Builds prompts for each reviewer with file list, diff, properties, and knowledge context. Irrelevant reviewers (based on file extensions) are marked for skipping.

### Phase 2: Finalize Review
```
orchestrator.finalize_review(request, responses, output_dir) -> ReviewResult
```
1. Parse subagent responses into findings
2. Deduplicate findings across reviewers (SHA-256 fingerprinting with +/-3 line tolerance)
3. Calculate Consensus Score
4. Generate markdown report

## Consensus Score (CS) Formula

```
CS = (0.5 * R_bar) + (0.3 * R_bar * (k/n)) + (0.2 * R_max)
```

Where:
- **R_i** = (severity * confidence) / 10 for each deduplicated finding
- **R_bar** = mean of all R_i values
- **k** = total reviewer agreements (sum of per-finding reviewer counts)
- **n** = 5 (total reviewers)
- **R_max** = max(R_i) across all findings

## Decision Tiers

| Tier | CS Range | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| Informational | CS < 4.0 | Log only, review passes |
| Moderate | 4.0 <= CS < 7.0 | Inline comment, review passes |
| Important | 7.0 <= CS < 9.0 | Block merge, review fails |
| Critical | CS >= 9.0 | Block + escalate, review fails |

## Minority Protection Rule (MPR)

Prevents a single critical finding from being diluted by many clean reviews:

```
IF R_max >= 8.5 AND k >= 1 AND finding is from security/reliability:
    CS_final = max(CS, 0.7 * R_max + 2.0)
```

## Finding Deduplication

Findings from different reviewers pointing to the same issue are merged:
- **Fingerprint**: SHA-256 of `file:normalized_line:category` (line tolerance +/-3)
- **Merge**: highest severity wins, all descriptions and remediations preserved
- **k tracking**: number of reviewers who flagged the same issue (increases CS)

## Output

### Review Report (REVIEW-TASK-XXX.md)

```markdown
# Review Report: TASK-001

**Status**: PASSED
**Consensus Score**: CS=3.50 (informational)
**Reviewers**: 5
**Findings**: 2

---

## Reviewer Summaries

### PASS: Security Reviewer
**Score**: 10.0/10
**Summary**: No security issues found.
**Findings**: 0

### PASS: Correctness Reviewer
**Score**: 8.5/10
**Summary**: Minor edge case.
**Findings**: 1

...

---

## Findings

### [MODERATE] src/auth.py:45
**Category**: validation
**Severity**: 5.0
**Confidence**: 7.0
**Reviewers**: correctness, reliability (k=2)
**R_i**: 3.50

**Description**: Missing input validation on user_id

**Remediation**:
- Add type check and bounds validation

---

## Summary

CS=3.50 (informational): 2 finding(s), review passed.
```

## Integration with WFC

### Called By
- `wfc-implement` - After agent completes TDD workflow

### Consumes
- Task files (from git worktree)
- PROPERTIES.md (formal properties to verify)
- Git diff content

### Produces
- Review report (REVIEW-{task_id}.md)
- Consensus Score decision (pass/fail with tier)
- Deduplicated findings with reviewer agreement counts

## Relevance Gate

Each reviewer has domain-specific file extensions. Only relevant reviewers execute:

| Reviewer | Relevant Extensions |
|----------|-------------------|
| Security | .py, .js, .ts, .go, .java, .rb, .php, .rs |
| Correctness | .py, .js, .ts, .go, .java, .rb, .rs, .c, .cpp |
| Performance | .py, .js, .ts, .go, .java, .rs, .sql |
| Maintainability | * (always relevant) |
| Reliability | .py, .js, .ts, .go, .java, .rs |

## Philosophy

**ELEGANT**: Simple two-phase workflow, deterministic reviewer set
**MULTI-TIER**: Engine (logic) separated from CLI (presentation)
**PARALLEL**: 5 reviewers can run concurrently via Task tool
**TOKEN-AWARE**: Relevance gate skips irrelevant reviewers

# WFC:BUILD - Intentional Vibe Coding

**"Vibe coding with guardrails"** - Quick iteration with WFC quality standards.

## What It Does

Simplified workflow that skips formal planning but maintains all WFC quality infrastructure:

1. **Adaptive Interview** - Quick clarifying questions (not full wfc-plan)
2. **Complexity Assessment** - Orchestrator decides: 1 agent or multi-agent?
3. **Subagent Delegation** - Spawn subagent(s) via Task tool (orchestrator NEVER implements)
4. **TDD Workflow** - Each subagent follows TEST → IMPLEMENT → REFACTOR
5. **Quality Gates** - Formatters, linters, tests (pre-review)
6. **Consensus Review** - Route through wfc-review
7. **Auto-Merge** - Merge to develop via PR (or rollback on failure)

## Usage

```bash
# Default: orchestrator asks clarifying questions
/wfc-build

# With description
/wfc-build "add progressive doc loader"

# With context
/wfc-build "add OAuth2 authentication to FastAPI backend"
```

## "Intentional Vibe" Philosophy

**Vibe Coding:**
- Fast iteration
- Minimal planning
- Just ship it

**+ WFC Guardrails:**
- Git worktrees (isolation)
- TDD workflow (tests first)
- Quality checks (formatters, linters)
- Consensus review (multi-agent)
- Auto-rollback (safety)

**= Intentional Vibe:**
- Quick enough to flow
- Structured enough to be safe
- Professional enough to ship

## Adaptive Interview

Orchestrator asks 3-5 quick questions:

```
Q1: What are you building?
A: Progressive documentation loader

Q2: Which files should this touch?
A: New files in wfc/shared/ and scripts/docs/

Q3: Expected behavior?
A: Load doc summaries, fetch full content on-demand

Q4: Tech stack?
A: Python, similar to persona_loader.py pattern
```

Then orchestrator assesses complexity and spawns subagent(s).

## Complexity Assessment

Orchestrator decides based on scope:

### Simple Task → 1 Subagent

**Examples:**
- "add a utility function"
- "create a doc loader"
- "fix a bug"
- "add a new endpoint"

**Flow:**
```
Spawn 1 subagent via Task tool
    ↓
Subagent implements in worktree (TDD)
    ↓
Quality check → Review → Merge
```

### Complex Task → N Subagents

**Examples:**
- "add OAuth2 authentication" (backend + frontend + security)
- "build a dashboard" (API + UI + charts)
- "refactor auth system" (multiple components)

**Flow:**
```
Spawn N subagents via Task tool (parallel)
    ↓
Subagent 1: Backend API (worktree-1)
Subagent 2: Frontend UI (worktree-2)
Subagent 3: Security validation (worktree-3)
    ↓
Each: TDD → Quality → Review
    ↓
Merge sequentially
```

## Orchestrator Responsibilities

**What orchestrator DOES:**
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions
- ✅ Assess task complexity
- ✅ Decide: 1 agent or N agents?
- ✅ Spawn subagent(s) via Task tool
- ✅ Wait for subagent completion
- ✅ Route through quality + review
- ✅ Coordinate merge/rollback

**What orchestrator NEVER DOES:**
- ❌ Write code
- ❌ Write tests
- ❌ Run formatters/linters
- ❌ Implement anything

**Critical Principle:** Orchestrator coordinates, NEVER implements.

## Subagent Workflow (Per Agent)

Each subagent follows TDD in isolated worktree:

```
1. UNDERSTAND
   - Read orchestrator's task spec
   - Review related files
   - Understand context

2. TEST_FIRST (RED)
   - Write tests BEFORE code
   - Run tests → FAIL

3. IMPLEMENT (GREEN)
   - Write minimum code to pass
   - Run tests → PASS

4. REFACTOR
   - Clean up code
   - Run tests → still PASS

5. QUALITY_CHECK
   - Run formatters (black, prettier, etc.)
   - Run linters (ruff, eslint, etc.)
   - Run tests
   - Blocks if checks fail

6. SUBMIT
   - Produce agent report
   - Return to orchestrator
```

## Architecture

```

## Integration with WFC

### Uses (delegates to):
- **Git worktrees** - Isolated implementation environments
- **Quality checker** - Pre-review gates (formatters, linters, tests)
- **wfc-review** - Consensus review with expert personas
- **Merge engine** - Auto-merge with rollback capability

### Produces:
- PR targeting develop branch (auto-merge for agent branches)
- Agent reports (telemetry)
- Review reports

### Skips:
- Formal TASKS.md generation
- Multi-tier planning
- Property formalization (uses lightweight acceptance criteria instead)

## When to Use

### Use wfc-build when:
- ✅ Single feature or small addition
- ✅ Want to iterate quickly
- ✅ Scope is clear from description
- ✅ "Just build this and ship it"

### Use wfc-plan + wfc-implement when:
- ✅ Large feature with multiple tasks
- ✅ Complex dependencies
- ✅ Need formal properties (SAFETY, LIVENESS, etc.)
- ✅ Multi-week effort

## Configuration

```json
{
  "build": {
    "interview_questions": 5,
    "complexity_threshold": "auto",
    "max_agents": 3,
    "enforce_tdd": true,
    "require_quality_check": true,
    "require_review": true
  }
}
```

## Example Session

```
User: /wfc-build "add rate limiting to API"

Orchestrator:
  Q: What's the main goal?
  A: Prevent API abuse, 100 requests/minute per user

  Q: Which endpoints?
  A: All /api/* endpoints

  Q: Tech stack?
  A: FastAPI, Redis for rate limit storage

  Q: Expected behavior on limit exceeded?
  A: Return 429 Too Many Requests

Orchestrator: Assessing complexity...
  → SIMPLE task (single component)
  → Spawning 1 subagent

Subagent-1 (worktree-1):
  ✅ TEST_FIRST: Write rate limit tests
  ✅ IMPLEMENT: Add FastAPI middleware + Redis client
  ✅ REFACTOR: Extract config, clean up
  ✅ QUALITY_CHECK: black, ruff, pytest → PASS
  ✅ SUBMIT: Agent report ready

Orchestrator:
  ✅ Route to wfc-review (5 personas)
  ✅ Consensus: APPROVED (8.5/10)
  ✅ Merge to main
  ✅ Integration tests: PASS

Done! ✅ Rate limiting added to API
```

## Philosophy

**ELEGANT:** Simple orchestration, clear delegation, no over-engineering
**INTENTIONAL:** Vibe coding + WFC guardrails = professional quality
**DELEGATED:** Orchestrator NEVER implements, ALWAYS delegates

## Git Workflow Policy (PR-First)

WFC creates feature branches, pushes them, and opens GitHub PRs for team review.

```
WFC workflow:
  Build -> Quality -> Review -> Push Branch -> Create GitHub PR to develop
                                                    |
                                              [WFC STOPS HERE]
                                                    |
                                  Auto-merge for claude/* branches
                                  Manual review for feat/* branches
```

Agent branches (claude/*) auto-merge to develop when CI passes. Human branches require manual review. Release candidates are cut from develop to main on a schedule.

**What WFC does:**
- Creates feature branches
- Pushes branches to remote
- Creates GitHub PRs targeting develop (draft by default)

**What WFC never does:**
- Push directly to main/master
- Force push
- Merge PRs to main (you decide when to cut releases)

**Legacy mode:** Set `"merge.strategy": "direct"` in wfc.config.json for local-only merge.

See [GIT_SAFETY_POLICY.md](../../../docs/security/GIT_SAFETY_POLICY.md) for complete policy.

- Fetched unresolved review threads via GraphQL — found 6 threads (3 duplicates on chunker.py, 2 duplicates on review_benchmark.py, 1 on review_benchmark.py encoding)
- After deduplication: 3 unique issues
- Triaged: all 3 as FIX
- User approved "Fix all 3 (Recommended)"
- Switched to `feat/teamcharter-integration` branch
- Fix 1 (chunker.py): `_make_chunk_id` updated to include `date`, `source` params and normalize text with `" ".join(text.split())`
- Fix 2 (review_benchmark.py:77): Updated docstring for `evaluate_findings()` — removed `reviewer_id` key reference, added actual keys
- Fix 3 (review_benchmark.py:70): Added `encoding="utf-8"` to `open()`
- Tests: 22 passed (chunker and benchmark)
- Committed and pushed to `feat/teamcharter-integration`

**2. Check for merge conflicts**
- User asked to check for merge conflicts on `feat/teamcharter-integration` vs main
- Found 1 conflict: `tests/test_teamcharter_integration.py` (add/add)
- main had 555-line version with `TestCustomerAdvocatePersona`; branch had 404-line version (intentionally removed since `CUSTOMER_ADVOCATE.json` doesn't exist on that branch)
- Merged `origin/main` into `feat/teamcharter-integration`
- Resolved: `git checkout --ours tests/test_teamcharter_integration.py` (kept our 404-line version)
- All 13 tests pass
- Committed merge resolution and pushed

**3. Create new PR combining PR #15 and PR #17**
- User: "create a new PR that brings in PR #15 and PR #17"
- PR #17: "feat: Wave 2 Kodus AI enhancements" on branch `claude/analyze-kodus-ai-3rAyd`
- Analyzed commits: both share base commits `96df32d → f126933 → 481eaca → 4326ab3 → 0a986ba`
- PR #15 unique: `53381dc` (Copilot fixes to chunker.py and review_benchmark.py) + `ac01432` (merge commit)
- PR #17 unique: 5 commits (f4de81c → ee9b013 → 7b33c69 → 24792c0 → b5996a2)
- Created `feat/integrate-pr15-pr17` from main
- Merged PR #17 → 6 conflicts
- Resolved conflicts:
  - CLAUDE.md, PLANNING.md, SKILL.md: took THEIRS (PR #17) for wfc-validate rename
  - test_teamcharter_integration.py, test_plan_validation_pipeline.py, TEAMCHARTER.md: took OURS (main, more complete)
- Cherry-picked `53381dc` from PR #15
- Fixed `test_plan_validation_pipeline.py`: updated assertions from `IsThisSmart Gate` → `Validate Gate` and `isthissmart_score` → `validate_score`
- Pushed and created PR #18: https://github.com/sam-fakhreddine/wfc/pull/18

**4. /wfc-review on PR #18**
- User invoked `/wfc-review`
- Identified 23 new Python source files across knowledge, benchmark, and review skill modules
- Launched 5 parallel reviewer agents (Security, Correctness, Performance, Maintainability, Reliability)
- Agents hit rate limit — user said "continue"
- Resumed all 5 agents
- Results:
  - Security: 6.2/10, 11 findings
  - Correctness: 5.8/10, 14 findings
  - Performance: 6.4/10, 13 findings
  - Maintainability: 7.1/10, 21 findings
  - Reliability: 4.2/10, 20 findings
- Synthesized into Consensus Report: CS=2.63 (Informational) but MPR elevates 7 findings to blocking
- Decision: Conditional Pass — 7 must-fix findings block merge

**5. Hook errors question**
- User asked about `PostToolUse:Task hook error` messages (×4)
- Explained: hooks run on all tool calls including Task tool; `context_monitor.py` and `post-task` hook don't handle Task events properly
- Found in `.claude/settings.json`: line 91 has `Task` in context_monitor matcher
- Solution: remove `Task` from the matcher

**6. /wfc-build to fix all 21 findings**
- User interrupted initial "fix" request and invoked `/wfc-build` with all 21 findings
- Assessed: complex multi-file task → 5 parallel subagents
- Grouped:
  - Agent 1: `emergency_bypass.py` (findings 1,2,3)
  - Agent 2: `rag_engine.py` (findings 4,5,6,16)
  - Agent 3: `reviewer_engine.py` + `fingerprint.py` (findings 7,9,11)
  - Agent 4: `knowledge_writer.py` (findings 8,14,15)
  - Agent 5: drift_detector.py + ast_analyzer.py + eval_judge.py + embeddings.py + finding_validator.py (findings 10,12,13,17,18,19,20,21)
- All 5 agents completed successfully
- Post-fix: 1 new test failure — `test_evaluate_both_empty_perfect_tn` asserting old buggy behavior (precision=0.0)
- Fixed: updated test to expect precision=1.0 (correct true-negative behavior)
- Final: 1079 passing, 0 new failures
- Committed: `fix: address 21 review findings` + pushed to PR #18

**7. Push**
- User said "push" — already up to date

**8. Request Copilot review**
- User: "request a Copilot review"
- Used `gh api repos/sam-fakhreddine/wfc/pulls/18/requested_reviewers -X POST -f "reviewers[]=copilot"`
- API returned PR details confirming the request was made

Current state: Branch `feat/integrate-pr15-pr17` pushed, PR #18 open, Copilot review requested.

Pending: None explicitly. The last action was requesting a Copilot review.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The session covered a full PR lifecycle workflow on the `sam-fakhreddine/wfc` repository:
   1. **Fix PR #15 Copilot comments** (`/wfc-pr-comments https://github.com/sam-fakhreddine/wfc/pull/15`) — triage and fix 3 unresolved review threads
   2. **Resolve merge conflicts** on `feat/teamcharter-integration` branch vs `main`
   3. **Create a new integration PR** combining PR #15 and PR #17 into a single conflict-free PR targeting `main`
   4. **Run consensus code review** (`/wfc-review`) on PR #18's 23 new Python source files
   5. **Fix all 21 review findings** (`/wfc-build`) — both must-fix and should-fix — across 9 files
   6. **Push** the fixes (already up to date)
   7. **Request a Copilot review** on PR #18

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **WFC Five-Agent Consensus Review**: Security, Correctness, Performance, Maintainability, Reliability reviewers with CS formula and Minority Protection Rule
   - **Agent Skills compliant skills**: wfc-pr-comments, wfc-review, wfc-build workflows
   - **Git merge conflict resolution**: add/add conflicts, content conflicts, cherry-picking unique commits
   - **Consensus Score (CS)**: `CS = (0.5 * R_bar) + (0.3 * R_bar * (k/n)) + (0.2 * R_max)` with MPR elevation for security/reliability findings ≥ 8.5
   - **Prompt injection (OWASP LLM01)**: sanitizing diff content before embedding in LLM prompts
   - **Path traversal**: user-controlled file stems joined to project root without containment check
   - **Atomic file writes**: tmp + `Path.replace()` pattern for safe writes
   - **RAG knowledge system**: chunker → embeddings → vector store → retriever pipeline
   - **TDD workflow**: subagents follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR in isolated parallel execution
   - **PostToolUse hooks**: `context_monitor.py`, `tdd_enforcer.py`, `file_checker.py` triggering on Task tool events (causing harmless errors)
   - **UV toolchain**: all Python operations use `uv run pytest`, `uv pip install`
   - **GitHub GraphQL API**: fetching unresolved PR review threads with `isResolved` filter
   - **Branch strategy**: `feat/integrate-pr15-pr17` → PR #18 targeting `main`

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **`wfc/scripts/knowledge/chunker.py`**
     - Fixed `_make_chunk_id` to accept `date`, `source` parameters and normalize text
     - Call sites updated to pass `normalized_text` and `normalized_source`
     ```python
     @staticmethod
     def _make_chunk_id(reviewer_id: str, section: str, date: str, source: str, text: str) -> str:
         """Generate a deterministic chunk ID from normalized content."""
         normalized_text = " ".join(text.split())
         raw = f"{reviewer_id}:{section}:{date}:{source}:{normalized_text}"
         return hashlib.sha256(raw.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()[:16]
     ```

   - **`wfc/scripts/benchmark/review_benchmark.py`**
     - Fixed docstring for `evaluate_findings()`: removed false `reviewer_id` key claim
     - Added `encoding="utf-8"` to `open(self._dataset_path)`
     ```python
     with open(self._dataset_path, encoding="utf-8") as f:
     ```

   - **`tests/test_teamcharter_integration.py`**
     - Merge conflict resolved by keeping `--ours` (main's 555-line version with TestCustomerAdvocatePersona) when merging PR #17 into integration branch
     - Previously kept our 404-line version (without TestCustomerAdvocatePersona) when resolving PR #15 conflicts

   - **`tests/test_plan_validation_pipeline.py`**
     - Updated assertions for wfc-isthissmart → wfc-validate rename:
     ```python
     # Before:
     assert "IsThisSmart Gate" in content
     # After:
     assert "Validate Gate" in content or "IsThisSmart Gate" in content
     # Before:
     "isthissmart_score",
     # After:
     "validate_score",
     ```

   - **`wfc/scripts/skills/review/emergency_bypass.py`**
     - Fix 1: `self._audit_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` before `mkstemp()`
     - Fix 2: `_load_raw()` wraps `json.loads` in try/except, renames corrupt file to `.corrupt`, returns `[]`
     - Fix 3: `_dict_to_record()` returns `BypassRecord | None`, full try/except, callers filter None

   - **`wfc/scripts/knowledge/rag_engine.py`**
     - Fix 4: `_JsonVectorStore.__init__` wraps JSON load in try/except, initializes `self._data = {}` on failure
     - Fix 5: Atomic write — write to `.tmp` then `Path.replace()`
     - Fix 6: `_load_hashes()` wraps JSON load in try/except, returns `{}` on failure
     - Fix 16: `_cosine_similarity()` replaced with numpy: `np.dot(a_arr, b_arr) / (norm_a * norm_b)`

   - **`wfc/scripts/skills/review/reviewer_engine.py`**
     - Fix 7: Non-greedy regex `r"\[[\s\S]*?\]"` replaced with `json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode()` + greedy fallback `r"\[[\s\S]*\]"`
     - Fix 11: `_sanitize_embedded_content()` helper — replaces triple backticks with `` ` ` ` ``, truncates at 50k chars; applied to diff_content, knowledge, and RAG content

   - **`wfc/scripts/skills/review/fingerprint.py`**
     - Fix 9: Upfront filter drops malformed findings (missing `file`, `line_start`, `category`); all key accesses changed to `.get()` with defaults:
     ```python
     f.get("file", ""), f.get("line_start", 0), f.get("category", "unknown")
     ```

   - **`wfc/scripts/knowledge/knowledge_writer.py`**
     - Fix 8: `prune_old_entries()` — `if not kp.is_file(): return 0` guard; `date.fromisoformat()` in try/except ValueError
     - Fix 14: `append_entries()` — reads file once per reviewer group, passes content to `_append_to_file(existing_content=...)`, writes once; `_append_to_file` returns `str | None` in batch mode
     - Fix 15: `_sanitize_entry_fields()` — strips newlines, truncates to 500 chars, escapes lines starting with `## ` or `- [`

   - **`wfc/scripts/knowledge/drift_detector.py`**
     - Fix 10: Path traversal containment check in `check_orphaned()`:
     ```python
     try:
         resolved.resolve().relative_to(self.project_root.resolve())
     except ValueError:
         logger.warning("Skipping path traversal attempt: %s", stem)
         continue
     ```
     - Fix 21: `encoding="utf-8"` added to all 6 `read_text()` calls

   - **`wfc/scripts/skills/review/ast_analyzer.py`**
     - Fix 12: Dotted imports register root component — `import os.path` now registers both `"os.path"` and `"os"` in `imported` dict
     - Fix 17: `isinstance(child, ast.withitem)` → `isinstance(child, ast.With)` in `_compute_complexity`

   - **`wfc/scripts/benchmark/eval_judge.py`**
     - Fix 13: True-negative case: `not ground_truth and not review_output` → `precision=1.0, recall=1.0, f1=1.0`
     - Fix 19: `judge_2` notes renamed to `"Judge 2 (deterministic fallback)"`; kappa edge case `p_e==1.0` returns `1.0` when inputs identical

   - **`wfc/scripts/knowledge/embeddings.py`**
     - Fix 20: `embed([])` early return: `if not texts: return []`; `fit([])` early return: `if not texts: return`

   - **`wfc/scripts/skills/review/finding_validator.py`**
     - Fix 18: Remove dead `_ = spec`; store as `self._last_cross_check_spec = cross_check_spec`; add debug log

   - **`tests/test_eval_framework.py`**
     - Corrected `test_evaluate_both_empty_perfect_tn`: updated `assert result.judge_1.precision == 0.0` → `assert result.judge_1.precision == 1.0`

   - **`.claude/settings.json`**
     - Identified that `Task` in the PostToolUse matcher at line 91 causes hook errors — solution: remove `Task` from `"matcher": "Read|Write|Edit|Bash|Task|Skill|Grep|Glob"`

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PostToolUse:Task hook error (×4)**: Hooks configured to run after Task tool calls but `context_monitor.py` and `post-task` hooks don't handle Task events. Harmless (fail-open). Fix: remove `Task` from the context_monitor matcher in `.claude/settings.json`. Not yet applied.
   - **Merge conflict in `tests/test_teamcharter_integration.py` (PR #15 vs main)**: `TestCustomerAdvocatePersona` exists on main but not on PR #15 branch. Resolved: `git checkout --ours` to keep 404-line PR branch version when resolving PR #15's conflict with main.
   - **6 merge conflicts when merging PR #17 into integration branch**: All were the wfc-isthissmart → wfc-validate rename. Resolved: THEIRS (PR #17) for CLAUDE.md/PLANNING.md/SKILL.md; OURS (main) for test files and TEAMCHARTER.md.
   - **`tests/test_plan_validation_pipeline.py` failures after merge**: Tests checked for `"IsThisSmart Gate"` and `"isthissmart_score"` but SKILL.md now has `"Validate Gate"` and `"validate_score"`. Fixed assertions to accept new naming.
   - **`test_evaluate_both_empty_perfect_tn` new failure after eval_judge fix**: Test asserted old buggy behavior (`precision == 0.0` for true-negative). Updated test to assert correct behavior (`precision == 1.0`).
   - **Rate limit on 5 parallel reviewer agents**: Hit limit mid-review. User said "continue" — resumed all 5 agents with their agent IDs (a7b623c, a62ddb4, a97ab83, a5295f8, a0faeba).

5. Problem Solving:
   - **PR comment deduplication**: 6 GraphQL threads reduced to 3 unique issues via same-file/same-line/same-body dedup
   - **Integration branch strategy**: Rather than merging PRs directly, created `feat/integrate-pr15-pr17` from main, merged PR #17 (larger), cherry-picked PR #15's unique commit (`53381dc`)
   - **Conflict resolution logic**: For rename conflicts → take THEIRS (new naming); for add/add files → take OURS (main is more complete/authoritative)
   - **Review scope**: Focused on 23 new Python source files vs 192 total changed files to keep review meaningful
   - **5-agent parallelization**: Grouped 21 findings into 5 logical clusters by file affinity to maximize parallel execution with no cross-agent dependencies

6. All user messages:
   - `/wfc-pr-comments https://github.com/sam-fakhreddine/wfc/pull/15`
   - "check for merge conflicts and fix them"
   - "create a new PR that brings in PR15 and PR17"
   - `/wfc-review`
   - "continue" (after rate limit hit)
   - "what are these: ⎿  PostToolUse:Task hook error ⎿  PostToolUse:Task hook error ⎿  PostToolUse:Task hook error ⎿  PostToolUse:Task hook error"
   - "please fix the issues with the code" [interrupted]
   - `/wfc-build fix these [21 findings from review]`
   - "push"
   - "request a Copilot review"
   - [Summary request — current message]

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Fix PostToolUse:Task hook noise**: Remove `Task` from the context_monitor hook matcher in `.claude/settings.json` (line 91) — identified but not yet applied
   - **Copilot review results**: PR #18 now has a Copilot review requested; once Copilot comments, `/wfc-pr-comments 18` would address them

8. Current Work:
   The last completed action was requesting a Copilot review on PR #18:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/sam-fakhreddine/wfc/pulls/18/requested_reviewers -X POST -f "reviewers[]=copilot"
   ```
   PR #18 ("feat: integrate PR #15 + PR #17 — Five-Agent Consensus Engine + Wave 2 Kodus AI") is on branch `feat/integrate-pr15-pr17`, targeting `main`, at commit `4d52fdb` with 1079 passing tests and 0 new failures. The branch contains all 21 review fixes committed as `fix: address 21 review findings (reliability, security, correctness, performance)`.

9. Optional Next Step:
   No explicit pending tasks remain. The most recent request ("request a Copilot review") has been completed. The natural next step — once Copilot posts its review comments — would be to run `/wfc-pr-comments 18` to triage and fix those comments, but this should only be done after the user confirms Copilot has completed its review.
