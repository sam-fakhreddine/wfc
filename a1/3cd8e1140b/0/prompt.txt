Implement the following plan:

# Fix CI Workflow Failures — Mock Claude Directory for install.sh

## Context

All CI workflows on PR #5 (and now main) fail at the "Install WFC skills" step. The root cause is identical across all 6 failing jobs: `install.sh --ci` checks for `$HOME/.claude` directory to detect Claude Code as a platform. GitHub Actions runners don't have Claude Code installed, so no platform is detected and the installer exits with code 1.

The devcontainer is now the definitive test environment. CI just needs skills installed so tests and validation can run — it doesn't need a real Claude Code installation.

## Root Cause

`install.sh` line 261: `if [ -d "$HOME/.claude" ]` — no directory = no platform = hard exit.

The `install-test` job in `ci.yml` already has the fix (line 192): `mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills` before running install.sh. The other 4 jobs that call install.sh are missing this.

## Fix

Add `mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills` before `./install.sh --ci` in these 3 workflow files:

### 1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `test` job (line 66-69)

```yaml
      - name: Install WFC skills
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
          chmod +x install.sh
          ./install.sh --ci
```

### 2. `.github/workflows/quick-check.yml` — `quick-check` job (line 36-39)

```yaml
      - name: Install WFC skills
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
          chmod +x install.sh
          ./install.sh --ci
```

### 3. `.github/workflows/validate.yml` — `test` job (line 33-36) AND `validate-skills` job (line 65-68)

Both jobs need the same fix:

```yaml
    - name: Install WFC skills
      run: |
        mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
        chmod +x install.sh
        ./install.sh --ci
```

### 4. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `install-test` job (line 194)

Already has `mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills` — the interactive `./install.sh <<< 'y'` test is failing because `y` isn't a valid branding choice (expects `1` or `2`). Fix the input:

```yaml
      - name: Test install script
        run: |
          chmod +x install.sh
          ./install.sh <<< '2'
```

## Files to Modify

1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — add mkdir to `test` job, fix input in `install-test` job
2. `.github/workflows/quick-check.yml` — add mkdir to `quick-check` job
3. `.github/workflows/validate.yml` — add mkdir to both `test` and `validate-skills` jobs

## Verification

Push to branch, check that all CI jobs pass:
```bash
gh run watch --repo sam-fakhreddine/wfc
```

what I am saying is, we can say if our container builds and all the checks in there, then we are good. put the WFC checks in there that are missing from your test script if there are any. so GH actions spins up the container and then ensures it builds

where did you push to
