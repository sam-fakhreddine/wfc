I need to be able to get the LATEST from the branch i am in to the system we are working in but hte isntaller seems wrong

---

ok and --ci mode should ensure we dont clobbber settings but we refresh all the actual application

---

and we dont need the verbosity of the all the skill copies its too much

---

888 -
      889 -    echo ""
      864  fi
      865
      866  # Success!
  ⎿  PostToolUse:Edit hook error
  ⎿  PostToolUse:Edit hook error
  ⎿  PostToolUse:Edit hook error

ok branch and pr please.

Please address the comments from this code review:

## Overall Comments
- The symlink vs copy logic for skills in the `STRATEGY=symlink` branch is now split across `REMOTE_INSTALL`, but the two loops are very similar; consider extracting a small helper or at least aligning the behavior/messages to avoid divergence (e.g., consistent handling when no skills are found, error reporting, and cleanup).
- The new KEEP_SETTINGS/CHANGE_BRANDING gating around `.wfc_branding` is more conservative, but the messaging (“settings preserved” / “settings kept”) now refers to multiple concepts; it might be clearer to explicitly list which settings are preserved vs refreshed to avoid confusion for users running in CI vs interactive mode.

<issue_to_address>
**issue (bug_risk):** Using `python3` in hooks while the installer still falls back to `python` can cause runtime failures on some systems.

`install-universal.sh` registers hooks by trying `python3` first and then falling back to `python`, but this change hardcodes `python3` in the hook itself. On systems with only `python`, install will succeed via the fallback, but hook execution will later fail. Consider either keeping `python` in the hook and delegating interpreter selection to the installer, resolving and writing the chosen interpreter into the settings at install time, or enforcing that `python3` must exist whenever it’s referenced in settings.
