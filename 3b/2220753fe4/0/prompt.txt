# wfc-vibe - Natural Brainstorming Mode

**Conversational mode for stream-of-consciousness brainstorming with smart transitions to structured workflows**

## What It Does

Natural chat interface that lets you brainstorm freely without workflow enforcement:
1. **Vibe naturally** - Just talk, no formal structure required
2. **Smart detection** - Recognizes when scope grows large (not annoying)
3. **Passive reminders** - Subtle hints every ~10 messages
4. **Easy transitions** - Say "let's plan this" to move to wfc-plan or wfc-build

## When to Use

**Use wfc-vibe when:**
- ✅ Brainstorming ideas
- ✅ Exploring possibilities
- ✅ Stream-of-consciousness thinking
- ✅ Not ready to commit to implementation

**Transition to planning when:**
- ⚠️ Scope growing large (>3 features)
- ⚠️ Ready to implement
- ⚠️ Need structured breakdown

## Usage

```bash
# Start vibe session (default mode in Claude Code)
# Just start chatting naturally - no special command needed

# When ready to plan:
"let's plan this"
"I want to implement this"
"let's build this"
```

## Philosophy

**CHILL:** Natural conversation, no pressure
**SMART:** Detects planning opportunities (not annoying)
**SMOOTH:** Easy transition with context preservation

**Not like ChatGPT/Gemini:** No constant "want me to create?" interruptions

## Key Behaviors

### What wfc-vibe DOES:
- ✅ Respond naturally like normal chat
- ✅ Track conversation context
- ✅ Passive reminder every ~10 messages (8-12 randomized)
- ✅ Detect when scope grows large (once per conversation)
- ✅ Smooth transition with relevant context summary

### What wfc-vibe DOESN'T DO:
- ❌ Force workflow transitions
- ❌ Interrupt natural flow
- ❌ Ask "want to plan?" constantly
- ❌ Be pushy or eager about planning

## Smart Detection

Suggests planning when:
- Multiple features mentioned (>3)
- Architecture discussion detected
- Many files mentioned (>5)
- Complexity indicators ("refactor", "migrate", "system")

**Max 1 suggestion per conversation** - not annoying

## Transition Preview

When you say "let's plan this":
```
📋 I'll help you plan this. Here's what I captured:

Goal: Build a REST API for user management
Features:
  - User authentication
  - Role-based access control
  - Audit logging
Estimated complexity: M

Route to: wfc-build (simple) or wfc-plan (complex)?
```

## Configuration

```json
{
  "vibe": {
    "reminder_frequency": [8, 12],
    "max_scope_suggestions": 1,
    "context_summarization_timeout": 5000,
    "transition_preview": true
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Natural Brainstorming
```
You: I'm thinking about adding user authentication
Claude: What kind of auth are you considering?
You: JWT tokens, maybe with Redis for sessions
Claude: Makes sense. How about the user model?
You: Probably email, password hash, role
...
(after 10 messages)
💡 *Tip: Say 'let's plan this' anytime to move to implementation*
```

### Scope Growing
```
You: We need auth, RBAC, audit logging, email notifications, webhooks
Claude: 💭 *This is growing into a sizable project. Consider using /wfc-plan to structure it when ready.*
```

### Smooth Transition
```
You: let's plan this

Claude:
📋 I'll help you plan this. Here's what I captured:

Goal: User management system with auth and RBAC
Features: authentication, roles, audit logs, email
Tech: JWT, Redis, PostgreSQL
Complexity: M (2-3 agents)

Ready to start with /wfc-build? (yes/no)
```

## Integration

- **Transitions to:** wfc-build (simple) or wfc-plan (complex)
- **Context:** Relevant info extracted automatically
- **Telemetry:** Tracks vibe sessions, transitions, suggestions
