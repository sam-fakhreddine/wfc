### Prompt 13

ok first tell me, why do you think implement is"  you that /wfc-implement is currently in development and not yet fully functional. Let me check what's actually available and provide you with the best path forward."

that was the first skill I ever did. 

before we implement do a deep dive on why you keep saying this
