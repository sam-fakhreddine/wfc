# WFC:PLAN - Adaptive Planning with Formal Properties

Converts requirements into structured implementation plans through adaptive interviewing.

## What It Does

1. **Adaptive Interview** - Asks intelligent questions that adapt based on answers
2. **Task Generation** - Breaks down requirements into structured TASKS.md with dependencies
3. **Property Extraction** - Identifies formal properties (SAFETY, LIVENESS, INVARIANT, PERFORMANCE)
4. **Test Planning** - Creates comprehensive TEST-PLAN.md linked to requirements and properties

## Usage

```bash
# Default (creates timestamped plan with history)
/wfc-plan
# → Generates: plans/plan_oauth2_authentication_20260211_143022/
#              plans/HISTORY.md
#              plans/HISTORY.json

# Custom output directory (disables history)
/wfc-plan path/to/output

# With options (future)
/wfc-plan --interactive  # Step through interview
/wfc-plan --from-file requirements.md  # Import requirements
```

## Plan History

**Each plan gets a unique timestamped directory.**

### Directory Structure

```

    └── interview-results.json
```

### History File

**plans/HISTORY.md** contains a searchable record:

```markdown
# Plan History

**Total Plans:** 3

---

## plan_user_dashboard_20260212_091523
- **Created:** 2026-02-12T09:15:23
- **Goal:** Build user analytics dashboard
- **Context:** Product team needs visibility into user behavior
- **Directory:** `plans/plan_user_dashboard_20260212_091523`
- **Tasks:** 7
- **Properties:** 4
- **Tests:** 15

## plan_caching_layer_20260211_150135
- **Created:** 2026-02-11T15:01:35
- **Goal:** Implement caching layer for API
- **Context:** Reduce database load and improve response times
- **Directory:** `plans/plan_caching_layer_20260211_150135`
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Properties:** 2
- **Tests:** 8
```

### Benefits

- **Version control** - Never lose old plans
- **Searchable** - Find plans by goal or date
- **Traceable** - See evolution of project planning
- **Reference** - Compare approaches across time

## Architecture Design Phase

After the interview, WFC generates 2-3 architecture approaches:

### Option 1: Minimal Changes
- Smallest diff, maximum code reuse
- Lowest risk, fastest to implement
- Best for simple features or hotfixes

### Option 2: Clean Architecture
- Proper abstractions, maintainability-first
- Best long-term design
- Higher initial effort

### Option 3: Pragmatic Balance
- Speed + quality tradeoff
- Addresses key concerns without over-engineering
- Best for most features

The approaches are saved to `ARCHITECTURE-OPTIONS.md` for reference.

## Interview Process

The adaptive interview gathers:

### Core Understanding
- What are you building? (goal)
- Why are you building it? (context)
- Who will use it? (users)

### Requirements
- Core features (must-have)
- Nice-to-have features
- Technical constraints
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements

### Technical Details
- Technology stack
- Existing codebase or new project
- Testing approach
- Coverage targets

### Formal Properties
- Safety properties (what must never happen)
- Liveness properties (what must eventually happen)
- Invariants (what must always be true)
- Performance properties (time/resource bounds)

## Outputs

### 1. TASKS.md
Structured implementation tasks with:
- Unique IDs (TASK-001, TASK-002, ...)
- Complexity ratings (S, M, L, XL)
- Dependency graph (DAG)
- Properties to satisfy
- Files likely affected
- Acceptance criteria

Example:
```markdown
## TASK-001: Setup project structure
- **Complexity**: S
- **Dependencies**: []
- **Properties**: []
- **Files**: README.md, pyproject.toml
- **Description**: Create initial project structure
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Project structure follows best practices
  - [ ] Dependencies documented
```

### 2. PROPERTIES.md
Formal properties with:
- Type (SAFETY, LIVENESS, INVARIANT, PERFORMANCE)
- Formal statement
- Rationale
- Priority
- Suggested observables

Example:
```markdown
## PROP-001: SAFETY
- **Statement**: Unauthenticated user must never access protected endpoints
- **Rationale**: Security: prevent unauthorized data access
- **Priority**: critical
- **Observables**: auth_failures, unauthorized_access_attempts
```

### 3. TEST-PLAN.md
Test strategy and cases:
- Testing approach (unit, integration, e2e)
- Coverage targets
- Specific test cases linked to tasks and properties
- Test steps and expected outcomes

Example:
```markdown
### TEST-001: Verify SAFETY property
- **Type**: integration
- **Related Task**: TASK-003
- **Related Property**: PROP-001
- **Description**: Test that unauthenticated users cannot access protected endpoints
- **Steps**:
  1. Attempt access without authentication
  2. Verify 401 response
- **Expected**: Access denied
```

# WFC:ISTHISSMART - Thoughtful Advisor

The experienced staff engineer who asks "is this the right approach?" before we commit.

## What It Does

Analyzes any WFC artifact (plan, architecture, idea) across 7 dimensions:

1. **Do We Even Need This?** - Real problem vs hypothetical
2. **Is This the Simplest Approach?** - Avoid over-engineering
3. **Is the Scope Right?** - Not too much, not too little
4. **What Are We Trading Off?** - Opportunity cost, maintenance burden
5. **Have We Seen This Fail Before?** - Anti-patterns, known failure modes
6. **What's the Blast Radius?** - Risk assessment, rollback plan
7. **Is the Timeline Realistic?** - Hidden dependencies, prototype first?

Returns balanced assessment with verdict: PROCEED, PROCEED WITH ADJUSTMENTS, RECONSIDER, or DON'T PROCEED.

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze current plan
/wfc-isthissmart

# Analyze a freeform idea
/wfc-isthissmart "rewrite auth system in Rust"

# Analyze specific artifact
/wfc-isthissmart --plan
/wfc-isthissmart --architecture
/wfc-isthissmart --task TASK-005
```

## Output: ISTHISSMART.md

```markdown
# Is This Smart? Analysis

## Subject: Rewrite auth system in Rust
## Verdict: 🟡 PROCEED WITH ADJUSTMENTS
## Overall Score: 7.5/10

---

## Executive Summary

Overall, this approach shows 12 clear strengths and 8 areas for consideration.

The strongest aspects are: Blast Radius, Need, Simplicity.

Key considerations: Opportunity cost of other features, Integration risks, Consider using existing library.

With an overall score of 7.5/10, this is a solid approach that can move forward with attention to the identified concerns.

---

## Dimension Analysis

### Do We Even Need This? — Score: 8/10

**Strengths:**
- Addresses clear user need
- Backed by data/metrics

**Concerns:**
- Consider if existing solution could be improved instead

**Recommendation:** Need is justified, but validate assumptions

[... 6 more dimensions ...]

---

## Simpler Alternatives

- Start with a simpler MVP and iterate based on feedback
- Consider using existing solution (e.g., off-the-shelf library)
- Phase the implementation - deliver core value first

---

## Final Recommendation

Proceed, but address these key concerns first: Opportunity cost of other features; Integration risks may extend timeline; Consider using existing library
```

## Tone

**Discerning but constructive. Honest but not harsh.**

Not a naysayer - wants us to succeed with the best approach. Highlights both strengths and concerns. Suggests simpler alternatives when appropriate.

## Verdict Logic

- **🟢 PROCEED**: Overall score >= 8.5/10, no critical concerns
- **🟡 PROCEED WITH ADJUSTMENTS**: Score 7.0-8.4, address concerns first
- **🟠 RECONSIDER**: Score 5.0-6.9, explore alternatives
- **🔴 DON'T PROCEED**: Score < 5.0 or any dimension <= 4/10

## Integration with WFC

### Can Analyze
- `wfc-plan` outputs (TASKS.md, PROPERTIES.md)
- `wfc-architecture` outputs (ARCHITECTURE.md)
- `wfc-security` outputs (THREAT-MODEL.md)
- Freeform ideas (text input)

### Produces
- ISTHISSMART.md report
- Simpler alternatives
- Final recommendation

## Philosophy

**ELEGANT**: Simple 7-dimension framework, clear logic
**MULTI-TIER**: Analysis (logic) separated from presentation
**PARALLEL**: Can analyze multiple artifacts concurrently


ARGUMENTS: Evaluate the TEAMCHARTER integration plan at .development/plans/plan_teamcharter_integration_20260215/TASKS.md — 10 tasks across 4 waves integrating team values governance into WFC. Key changes: (1) TEAMCHARTER.md values manifest + machine-readable JSON, (2) Customer Advocate persona, (3) Simplicity dimension in consensus review, (4) TEAMCHARTER questions in wfc-plan interview, (5) Plan validation flow redesign: Plan → IsThisSmart → Revise → Code Review → Revise → Final with audit trail, (6) ReflexionMemory values tracking, (7) Say:Do ratio in wfc-retro, (8) Experiment mode for wfc-build, (9) Documentation updates, (10) Integration tests. Architecture options are in ARCHITECTURE-OPTIONS.md — we chose Option 2 (two-gate validation, not iterative loop).

# WFC:CONSENSUS-REVIEW - Multi-Agent Consensus Code Review

Four specialized agents review code and reach consensus decision.

## What It Does

1. **Code Review Agent (CR)** - Correctness, readability, maintainability
2. **Security Agent (SEC)** - Security vulnerabilities, auth/authz
3. **Performance Agent (PERF)** - Performance issues, scalability
4. **Complexity Agent (COMP)** - Complexity, architecture, ELEGANT principles
5. **Consensus Algorithm** - Weighted voting with veto power

**Enhanced with Systematic Checklist**: Each reviewer follows the 6-step review methodology from CHECKLIST.md (Understand Context → Functionality → Quality → Security → Performance → Tests) to ensure comprehensive, consistent reviews.

## Usage

```bash
# Review specific task
/wfc-consensus-review TASK-001

# Review files directly
/wfc-consensus-review path/to/code

# With options
/wfc-consensus-review TASK-001 --properties PROP-001,PROP-002
```

## Agent Weighting

- **Security (SEC)**: 35% - Highest priority
- **Code Review (CR)**: 30% - Correctness
- **Performance (PERF)**: 20% - Scalability
- **Complexity (COMP)**: 15% - Maintainability

## Consensus Rules

1. **All agents must pass** (score >= 7/10)
2. **Overall score** = weighted average
3. **Any critical severity** = automatic fail
4. **Overall score >= 7.0** required to pass

## Review Methodology

Each reviewer follows the systematic 6-step checklist (see `CHECKLIST.md`):

### 1. UNDERSTAND CONTEXT
- Read task description, acceptance criteria, properties
- Understand the "why" behind changes
- Review test strategy

### 2. REVIEW FUNCTIONALITY
- Verify acceptance criteria met
- Check edge case handling
- Validate error handling and input validation

### 3. REVIEW CODE QUALITY
- Readability and naming conventions
- ELEGANT principles compliance
- SOLID/DRY principles
- Function size and complexity

### 4. REVIEW SECURITY
- Input validation, SQL injection, XSS prevention
- Authentication/authorization checks
- No hardcoded secrets
- Sensitive data protection

### 5. REVIEW PERFORMANCE
- N+1 query prevention
- Algorithm efficiency
- Memory management
- Appropriate caching

### 6. REVIEW TESTS
- Coverage of happy path and edge cases
- Property verification (SAFETY, LIVENESS, etc.)
- Test quality and independence

**Reviewer-Specific Focus**:
- **CR**: Steps 2 (Functionality), 3 (Quality), 6 (Tests)
- **SEC**: Steps 2 (Input validation), 4 (Security)
- **PERF**: Steps 5 (Performance), 6 (Performance tests)
- **COMP**: Step 3 (Complexity, ELEGANT principles)

## Output

### Review Report (REVIEW-TASK-XXX.md)

```markdown
# Code Review Report: TASK-001

```

## Integration with WFC

### Called By
- `wfc-implement` - After agent completes TDD workflow

### Consumes
- Task files (from git worktree)
- PROPERTIES.md (formal properties to verify)
- Test results (from TDD workflow)

### Produces
- Review report (REVIEW-{task_id}.md)
- Consensus decision (pass/fail)
- Detailed comments per file/line

## Configuration

```json
{
  "review": {
    "min_overall_score": 7.0,
    "require_all_agents_pass": true,
    "fail_on_critical": true,
    "agent_weights": {
      "CR": 0.3,
      "SEC": 0.35,
      "PERF": 0.2,
      "COMP": 0.15
    }
  }
}
```

## Confidence Filtering

Review comments include confidence scores (0-100). Low-confidence findings are automatically filtered:

- **Default threshold**: 80 (configurable)
- **Critical severity**: Always shown regardless of confidence
- **Report shows**: "12 reported (8 filtered as low-confidence)"

## Post-Review Simplification

Use `--simplify` to run an optional Code Simplifier pass after review approval:

```bash
/wfc-review TASK-001 --simplify
```

When enabled, the Code Simplifier persona analyzes approved code for:
- Unnecessary complexity
- Redundant abstractions
- Deep nesting
- Over-engineering

## Philosophy

**ELEGANT**: Simple agent logic, clear consensus rules
**MULTI-TIER**: Agents (logic) separated from CLI (presentation)
**PARALLEL**: Agents can run concurrently (future optimization)


ARGUMENTS: Review the revised TEAMCHARTER integration plan at .development/plans/plan_teamcharter_integration_20260215/. Focus on: (1) TASKS.md — 9 tasks + 1 deferred, dependency correctness, acceptance criteria completeness (2) PROPERTIES.md — 8 properties, coverage of all tasks (3) TEST-PLAN.md — 15 test cases, do they cover the revised tasks? (4) ARCHITECTURE-OPTIONS.md — Option 2 selected (5) revision-log.md — were IsThisSmart critiques properly addressed? This is a PLAN review, not a code review. Evaluate: dependency graph correctness, scope appropriateness, property coverage, acceptance criteria clarity, test coverage gaps.

# Override agent count
/wfc-implement --agents 5

# Override strategy

  }
}
```

## TDD Workflow (Per Agent)

```
1. UNDERSTAND
   - Read task definition
   - Read properties
   - Read test plan
   - Read existing code

2. TEST FIRST (RED)
   - Write tests BEFORE implementation
   - Tests cover acceptance criteria
   - Tests cover properties
   - Run tests → they FAIL

3. IMPLEMENT (GREEN)
   - Write minimum code to pass tests
   - Follow ELEGANT principles
   - Run tests → they PASS

4. REFACTOR
   - Clean up without changing behavior
   - Maintain SOLID & DRY
   - Run tests → still PASS

5. SUBMIT
   - Commit to worktree branch
   - Produce agent report
   - Route to wfc-consensus-review
```

## Dependencies

- **Consumes**: TASKS.md, PROPERTIES.md, TEST-PLAN.md (from wfc-plan)
- **Integrates**: wfc-consensus-review (for code review)
- **Produces**: Merged code on main, telemetry records, agent reports

## Philosophy

**ELEGANT**: Simple agent logic, clear orchestration, no over-engineering
**MULTI-TIER**: Presentation/Logic/Data/Config cleanly separated
**PARALLEL**: Maximum concurrency where safe (agents, tasks, reviews)

## Git Safety Policy

**CRITICAL:** WFC NEVER pushes to remote. User must push manually.

```
WFC workflow:
  Implement → Quality → Review → Merge to LOCAL main → Integration tests
                                        ↓
                                [WFC STOPS HERE]
                                        ↓
                             User reviews and pushes:
                                git push origin main
```

**Why:**
- ✅ User control before remote changes
- ✅ Review merged result before push
- ✅ Respects branch protection rules
- ✅ Easy to revert before push
- ✅ User decides: push, PR, or revert

See [GIT_SAFETY_POLICY.md](../../../docs/security/GIT_SAFETY_POLICY.md) for complete policy.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Done
- Orchestrator (task queue, dependency management)
- Shared infrastructure (config, telemetry, schemas, utils)
- Mock dependencies (wfc-plan, wfc-consensus-review)

### 🚧 In Progress
- Agent TDD workflow
- Merge engine with rollback
- Dashboard

### 📋 TODO
- CLI interface
- Full integration tests
- Performance optimization
- Real wfc-plan and wfc-consensus-review integration


ARGUMENTS: full send

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User invoked `/wfc-plan` with their team charter (Pod G) wanting to integrate it into the WFC workflow. They wanted to understand how it would influence the workflow.

2. **Analysis Phase**: I created a detailed analysis mapping Pod G values to WFC equivalents, identifying gaps and concrete changes for each value. User then said "dont mention pod g anywhere in your plan or analysis use TEAMCHARTER instead" and to write the analysis to file and create a plan.

3. **Plan Creation**: I wrote TEAMCHARTER-ANALYSIS.md and created the full plan structure (TASKS.md, PROPERTIES.md, TEST-PLAN.md, ARCHITECTURE-OPTIONS.md) with 10 tasks across 4 waves.

4. **User feedback on plan flow**: User said "I also want to modify the flow of plan so that it goes to ISTHISSMART.md, gets revised based on that then goes to code review, gets revised if needed and then creates the plan. we were blindly trusting our plan mode which breaks our value proposition" - This was incorporated into TASK-005.

5. **IsThisSmart validation**: User said "yeah eat our dogfood always never ask that!" when I asked if they wanted to run IsThisSmart. I saved this preference and ran the critique.

6. **IsThisSmart results**: Score 7.2/10 with key findings: TASK-003 wrong mechanism, TASK-005 underscoped, TASK-008 premature, revision mechanism hand-waved.

7. **Pipeline behavior**: User said "its a pipeline, you dont stop a pipeline unless there is a catastrophe" when I asked about applying adjustments. Saved as standing rule.

8. **Plan revision v1**: Applied IsThisSmart findings - restructured TASK-003, split TASK-005, deferred TASK-008, simplified TASK-001.

9. **Code Review round 1**: Scored 6.5/10 (CR:6, SEC:6, PERF:8, COMP:6.5). Major findings: stale TEST-PLAN.md, orphaned references, no audit hash verification, prompt injection risk.

10. **Plan revision v2**: Applied all critical/high review findings - rewrote TEST-PLAN.md, fixed cross-references, added SHA-256 hashing, JSON schema validation, prompt injection defense (PROP-009).

11. **Code Review round 2**: User said "send back until you get 8.5+". Scored 8.78/10 (CR:9, SEC:9, PERF:9, COMP:7.5). PASS.

12. **Workflow codification**: User said "ok rereviews to 8.5 should be part of the workflow and then you are ready to implement". Saved rule and updated TASK-005b.

13. **Implementation**: User invoked `/wfc-implement` with "full send". Created feature branch `feat/teamcharter-integration`, set up task tracking with dependencies.

14. **Wave 1**: Completed TASK-001 - Created TEAMCHARTER.md and teamcharter_values.json with 14 passing tests.

15. **Wave 2**: Launched 4 parallel agents for TASK-002, TASK-003, TASK-004, TASK-006.
    - TASK-002 (Customer Advocate persona): Completed, 12/12 tests passed
    - TASK-003 (Complexity budget gate): Completed, 24/24 tests passed
    - TASK-004 (Interview questions): Still running when summary requested
    - TASK-006 (Memory values tracking): Still running when summary requested

Key user preferences saved to MEMORY.md:
- Always eat dogfood (auto-run IsThisSmart after plan)
- Pipeline never stops (don't pause between stages)
- Review loop until 8.5+ (standard, not optional)
- Use TEAMCHARTER not internal team names

The implementation is mid-Wave 2 with 2 of 4 agents completed and 2 still running.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user wants to integrate their team charter (referred to as TEAMCHARTER, never "Pod G") into the WFC workflow as enforceable governance. The charter has 6 core values: Innovation & Experimentation, Accountability & Simplicity, Teamwork & Collaboration, Continuous Learning & Curiosity, Customer Focus & Service Excellence, and Trust & Autonomy. The user wants these values codified into how WFC workflow and agents act. Additionally, the user explicitly requested redesigning the plan flow to: Plan → IsThisSmart → Revise → Code Review (loop until 8.5+) → Final Plan, because "we were blindly trusting our plan mode which breaks our value proposition." The user established three standing rules: (1) always auto-run IsThisSmart after generating a plan, (2) never stop the pipeline between stages unless catastrophe, (3) re-review until 8.5+ consensus score.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **TEAMCHARTER values governance** — 6 values mapped to enforceable WFC mechanisms
   - **Plan validation pipeline** — Plan → IsThisSmart → Revise → Code Review → loop until 8.5+ → Final
   - **Complexity-budget pre-review gate** — S≤50lines/2files, M≤200/5, L≤500/10, XL≤1000/20 (replaced original SIMP consensus weight approach)
   - **Customer Advocate persona** — new product panel persona with review_dimensions summing to 1.0
   - **ReflexionMemory values tracking** — optional `team_values_impact` and `values_alignment` fields with backward compatibility
   - **Say:Do ratio** — (tasks completed at estimated complexity) / (total tasks) for wfc-retro
   - **Skill-to-skill invocation** — prompt-level orchestration where SKILL.md instructs Claude to invoke another skill via Skill tool
   - **SHA-256 audit trail** — immutable, timestamped plan-audit.json with hash verification (PROP-005)
   - **Prompt injection defense** — XML content delimiting when plan content passed to IsThisSmart/Review (PROP-009)
   - **JSON Schema validation** — strict schema for teamcharter_values.json and persona JSON files
   - **Wave-based parallel execution** — 4 waves with dependency management, parallel agents per wave

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`.claude/projects/-home-sambou-repos-wfc/memory/MEMORY.md`** — Updated with user preferences
     - Added: Always eat dogfood, pipeline never stops, review loop until 8.5+, use TEAMCHARTER not internal names

       {"id": "innovation", "name": "Innovation & Experimentation", "description": "...", "keywords": [...]},
       {"id": "accountability", ...}, {"id": "teamwork", ...}, {"id": "learning", ...},
       {"id": "customer_focus", ...}, {"id": "trust", ...}
     ]}
     ```

   - **`tests/test_teamcharter_values.py`** — CREATED (TASK-001) — 14 tests: schema validation, all 6 values present, no extra fields, malformed JSON handling, no internal team name. All passing.

   - **`wfc/references/personas/panels/product/CUSTOMER_ADVOCATE.json`** — CREATED (TASK-002 by agent)
     - review_dimensions: customer_value(0.35), team_values_alignment(0.30), user_clarity(0.20), scope_appropriateness(0.15)
     - selection_criteria.properties includes TEAM_VALUES_ALIGNMENT

   - **`tests/test_customer_advocate_persona.py`** — CREATED (TASK-002 by agent) — 12 tests all passing

   - **`wfc/scripts/complexity_budget_gate.py`** — CREATED (TASK-003 by agent) — ~306 lines
     - `COMPLEXITY_BUDGETS` dict with S/M/L/XL tiers

     - Adding `values_alignment: Optional[str] = None` to OperationalPattern
     - Updating from_dict() for backward compatibility (filter unknown fields)

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **IsThisSmart found TASK-003 used wrong enforcement mechanism**: Original plan added a 5th "SIMP" weight to consensus algorithm. IsThisSmart critique pointed out the Code Simplifier persona already handles subjective simplicity, and adding a weight just dilutes scoring. Fixed by restructuring to a complexity-budget pre-review gate instead.
   - **Code Review found TEST-PLAN.md was stale after revision**: TEST-003/004 still referenced old SIMP consensus weight design, TEST-014 tested deferred experiment mode. Fixed by fully rewriting TEST-PLAN.md to align with revised task designs.
   - **Code Review found orphaned TASK-010 references**: PROPERTIES.md referenced TASK-010 which didn't exist after task renumbering. Fixed by updating all references to TASK-009.
   - **SEC agent found no hash verification on audit trail**: PROP-007 claimed immutability but had no cryptographic verification. Fixed by adding PROP-005 (SHA-256 hash integrity) and updating TASK-005b acceptance criteria.
   - **SEC agent found prompt injection risk**: Plans passed to IsThisSmart could contain adversarial content. Fixed by adding PROP-009 requiring XML content delimiting.
   - **SEC agent found no JSON Schema validation**: TASK-001/002 lacked formal schema specs. Fixed by adding JSON Schema validation to acceptance criteria.
   - **First code review scored 6.5/10 (FAIL)**: Applied all 11 findings, re-reviewed to 8.78/10 (PASS).

5. Problem Solving:
   - Solved the "bootstrapping paradox" — validated the plan for building the plan validator by manually running the pipeline (IsThisSmart + Code Review)
   - Resolved the skill-to-skill invocation question — prompt-level orchestration via SKILL.md instructions, not programmatic Python-to-Python calls
   - Resolved the revision mechanism question — LLM re-pass where Claude reads ISTHISSMART.md and applies critique using judgment, not programmatic text transforms

6. All User Messages:
   - "I want to add something to our workflow tell me how it would influence it. this is the charter that my team and I developed at my day job..." (initial request with full Pod G charter)
   - "dont mention pod g anywhere in your plan or analysis use TEAMCHARTER instead. write your above analysis to file and create then create a plan."
   - "I also want to modify the flow of plan so that it goes to ISTHISSMART.md, gets revised based on that then goes to code review, gets revised if needed and then creates the plan. we were blindly trusting our plan mode which breaks our value proposition"
   - "yeah eat our dogfood always never ask that!" (re: running IsThisSmart on plans)
   - "its a pipeline, you dont stop a pipeline unless there is a catastrophe" (re: pausing between pipeline stages)
   - "send back until you get 8.5+" (re: code review score threshold)
   - "ok rereviews to 8.5 should be part of the workflow and then you are ready to implement"
   - "/wfc-implement full send"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **TASK-004** (Wave 2): Interview TEAMCHARTER questions — agent `adb118c` still running
   - **TASK-006** (Wave 2): ReflexionMemory values tracking — agent `a1afa12` still running
   - **TASK-005a** (Wave 3): IsThisSmart Gate + Revision in wfc-plan SKILL.md
   - **TASK-005b** (Wave 3): Review Gate + Audit Trail with SHA-256 and 8.5+ loop
   - **TASK-007** (Wave 3): Say:Do Ratio Tracking in wfc-retro
   - **TASK-008** (Wave 4): Update CLAUDE.md and PLANNING.md documentation
   - **TASK-009** (Wave 4): Integration tests (5 cross-component smoke tests)
   - After implementation: run full test suite, commit, push branch, create PR

8. Current Work:
   Executing Wave 2 of `/wfc-implement` for the TEAMCHARTER integration plan. On branch `feat/teamcharter-integration`. Wave 1 (TASK-001) is complete. Wave 2 has 4 parallel agents:
   - TASK-002 (Customer Advocate persona): **COMPLETED** — 12/12 tests passed
   - TASK-003 (Complexity budget gate): **COMPLETED** — 24/24 tests passed  
   - TASK-004 (Interview questions): **RUNNING** — agent `adb118c` modifying `wfc/skills/wfc-plan/interview.py`
   - TASK-006 (Memory values tracking): **RUNNING** — agent `a1afa12` modifying `wfc/scripts/memory/schemas.py`
   
   I was in the process of collecting TaskOutput from the remaining agents (TASK-003 output was just received showing 24/24 pass). Need to wait for TASK-004 and TASK-006 agents to complete, then proceed to Wave 3.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Wait for TASK-004 (agent `adb118c`) and TASK-006 (agent `a1afa12`) to complete, verify their tests pass, mark them complete, then proceed to Wave 3: TASK-005a (IsThisSmart gate), TASK-005b (Review gate + audit trail), and TASK-007 (Say:Do ratio) in parallel where possible. This continues the `/wfc-implement full send` command the user explicitly requested.

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Context from previous session**: The user invoked `/wfc-implement full send` to implement a TEAMCHARTER integration plan across 9 tasks in 4 waves. Wave 1 (TASK-001) and Wave 2 (TASK-002, 003, 004, 006) were completed in the previous session.

2. **This session started** as a continuation. I needed to:
   - Check status of remaining Wave 2 agents (TASK-004 and TASK-006)
   - Complete Waves 3 and 4

3. **Wave 2 completion**: Both TASK-004 (agent adb118c) and TASK-006 (agent a1afa12) completed successfully:
   - TASK-004: 26/26 tests passed (interview TEAMCHARTER questions)
   - TASK-006: 21/21 tests + 4 existing memory tests passed (memory values tracking)
   - 9 pre-existing failures unrelated to changes (wfc.skills.implement import issues)

4. **Wave 3 launch**: Two parallel agents:
   - ae8e516: TASK-005a+005b (Plan validation pipeline - IsThisSmart gate + Review gate + Audit trail)
   - abec85e: TASK-007 (Say:Do ratio tracking)

5. **TASK-007 completed**: Agent abec85e finished with 18/18 tests:
   - Created `wfc/scripts/memory/saydo.py` with 4 functions
   - Created `tests/test_saydo_ratio.py` with 18 tests
   - Updated `wfc/skills/wfc-retro/SKILL.md` with Values Alignment section
   - Updated `wfc/scripts/memory/__init__.py` with new exports

6. **TASK-005a+005b agent issues**: Agent ae8e516 hit permission issues writing to `~/.claude/skills/wfc-plan/SKILL.md` (both Write and Bash denied for paths outside repo). Created tests successfully (36 tests in `tests/test_plan_validation_pipeline.py`) but couldn't write SKILL.md.

7. **User message**: "hey we are developing the WFC skills so we need to update the repo we are in, I dont know how to make you remember that" — User clarified that SKILL.md canonical location is in the repo (`wfc/skills/wfc-*/SKILL.md`), not just `~/.claude/skills/`.

8. **I handled it by**:
   - Saving to MEMORY.md: "SKILL.md canonical location: wfc/skills/wfc-*/SKILL.md in the repo"
   - Writing the SKILL.md updates myself to `~/.claude/skills/wfc-plan/SKILL.md`
   - Copying installed SKILL.md back to repo: `cp ~/.claude/skills/wfc-plan/SKILL.md wfc/skills/wfc-plan/SKILL.md`
   - Also synced retro SKILL.md: `cp wfc/skills/wfc-retro/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/wfc-retro/SKILL.md`
   - Ran tests: 36/36 passed

9. **Wave 4 launch**: Two parallel agents:
   - a45158b: TASK-008 (Update CLAUDE.md and PLANNING.md)
   - a863fb1: TASK-009 (Integration tests)

10. **Wave 4 completion**:
    - TASK-008: Updated CLAUDE.md (added TEAMCHARTER-Validated Planning section) and PLANNING.md (added TEAMCHARTER Governance section). Verified with grep.
    - TASK-009: Created `tests/test_teamcharter_integration.py` with 17 integration tests, all passing. Fixed lint issues (removed unused MagicMock import).

11. **Formatting issues noted**: `make lint` showed 5 files needing black formatting. Some agents ran black on their files, some didn't.

Now let me catalog all the files and changes:

**Pending work**: Need to format all files with black, run full test suite, and potentially commit/create PR.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user invoked `/wfc-implement full send` to execute the TEAMCHARTER integration plan — 9 active tasks across 4 waves integrating team values governance into the WFC workflow. The plan was previously created, validated through IsThisSmart (7.2/10) and Code Review (8.78/10), and is being implemented on branch `feat/teamcharter-integration`. The user's standing rules are: (1) always eat dogfood — auto-run IsThisSmart after plans, (2) pipeline never stops between stages, (3) review loop until 8.5+ consensus score, (4) use TEAMCHARTER not internal team names. During this session, the user also explicitly stated that SKILL.md files should be updated in the repo (`wfc/skills/wfc-*/SKILL.md`) as the canonical location, not just `~/.claude/skills/`.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **TEAMCHARTER values governance**: 6 core values (Innovation, Accountability, Teamwork, Learning, Customer Focus, Trust) codified into WFC workflow enforcement
   - **Plan validation pipeline**: Plan → IsThisSmart → Revise → Code Review (loop until 8.5+) → Final Plan — now codified in wfc-plan SKILL.md
   - **Prompt-level orchestration**: SKILL.md instructions tell Claude to invoke `/wfc-isthissmart` and `/wfc-review` as skills (no Python-to-Python calls)
   - **PROP-009 prompt injection defense**: XML `<plan-content>` tags delimit plan content when passed to validation gates
   - **SHA-256 audit trail**: `plan-audit.json` with hash_algorithm, original_hash, final_hash, scores, timestamps
   - **Complexity-budget pre-gate**: S≤50lines/2files, M≤200/5, L≤500/10, XL≤1000/20
   - **Say:Do ratio**: (tasks completed at estimated complexity) / total tasks
   - **Wave-based parallel execution**: 4 waves with dependency management, parallel agents per wave
   - **TDD workflow**: Tests written first (RED), then implementation (GREEN)
   - **SKILL.md canonical location**: `wfc/skills/wfc-*/SKILL.md` in the repo; `~/.claude/skills/` are installed copies

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`wfc/skills/wfc-plan/SKILL.md`** (and installed copy at `~/.claude/skills/wfc-plan/SKILL.md`)
     - Core deliverable for TASK-005a+005b — the plan validation pipeline instructions
     - Added `## Plan Validation Pipeline` section with 6 steps: SHA-256 hash, IsThisSmart Gate, Revision Mechanism, Review Gate (8.5+ loop), Audit Trail, History Update

   - **`wfc/scripts/memory/saydo.py`** — Created by agent abec85e
     - `compute_say_do_ratio(tasks: List[Dict]) -> float` — ratio of on-estimate tasks
     - `aggregate_values_alignment(entries: List[ReflexionEntry]) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, int]]` — count violated/upheld per value
     - `generate_values_mermaid_chart(alignment: Dict) -> str` — Mermaid xychart-beta bar chart
     - `generate_values_recommendations(alignment: Dict) -> List[str]` — actionable recommendations sorted by violation rate

   - **`tests/test_saydo_ratio.py`** — Created (18 tests)
     - TestComputeSayDoRatio (7 tests): perfect, partial, empty, all failed, quality gate, re-estimation, missing fields
     - TestAggregateValuesAlignment (4 tests): basic, empty, no values impact, mixed
     - TestGenerateValuesMermaidChart (3 tests): valid syntax, empty, single value
     - TestGenerateValuesRecommendations (4 tests): mentions values, empty, no violations, high violation rate

   - **`wfc/skills/wfc-retro/SKILL.md`** — Modified by agent abec85e

     - Lists 6 core values with enforcement mechanisms, validated plan flow diagram, file references

   - **`tests/test_teamcharter_integration.py`** — Created by agent a863fb1 (17 tests)
     - TestInterviewToPlanFlow (2 tests): interview captures values, serialization round-trip
     - TestComplexityBudgetGate (4 tests): S exceeds/within, L within, serialization
     - TestCustomerAdvocatePersona (4 tests): exists, has TEAM_VALUES_ALIGNMENT, weights sum to 1.0, has values skill

     - TestPlanAuditTrailSchema (3 tests): schema structure, team_values_alignment, JSON serialization
     - TestEndToEndTeamcharterFlow (1 test): full flow integration

   - **`.claude/projects/-home-sambou-repos-wfc/memory/MEMORY.md`** — Updated
     - Added: "SKILL.md canonical location: wfc/skills/wfc-*/SKILL.md in the repo. ~/.claude/skills/ are installed copies. Always update the REPO copy first, then sync to installed."

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **Agent ae8e516 (TASK-005a+005b) permission denied for `~/.claude/skills/wfc-plan/SKILL.md`**: Both Write and Bash tools were denied permission for the installed SKILL.md path. The agent created tests successfully but couldn't write the SKILL.md. I handled it by writing the SKILL.md myself from the main agent context (which has broader permissions), then synced to repo with `cp`.
   - **User feedback on SKILL.md location**: User said "hey we are developing the WFC skills so we need to update the repo we are in, I dont know how to make you remember that" — I saved this to MEMORY.md and synced both directions (installed ↔ repo).
   - **Formatting issues**: `make lint` showed 5 files needing black formatting (test_customer_advocate_persona.py, test_teamcharter_values.py, test_plan_validation_pipeline.py, test_teamcharter_interview.py, interview.py). Some agents ran black on their files, some didn't. The integration test agent (a863fb1) ran `uv run black` and `uv run ruff --fix` to clean up unused MagicMock import.
   - **9 pre-existing test failures**: All from `wfc.skills.implement` module import issues (hyphenated directory) and stale `argument-hint` test in test_build_cli.py — unrelated to TEAMCHARTER changes.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Resolved agent permission issues by having the main agent write SKILL.md files that subagents couldn't
   - Synced SKILL.md between repo and installed locations in both directions
   - Managed wave-based parallel execution with proper dependency tracking
   - All 9 TEAMCHARTER tasks successfully implemented with tests passing

6. All User Messages:
   - "hey we are developing the WFC skills so we need to update the repo we are in, I dont know how to make you remember that" — User clarified that SKILL.md canonical location is in the repo, agents should update repo copies not just installed copies
   - (No other explicit user messages in this session — the rest was continuation of `/wfc-implement full send` from previous session)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Run `make format` to fix 5 files with black formatting issues
   - Run full test suite to verify no regressions (expect 9 pre-existing failures only)
   - Update task tracker: mark TASK-008 (#9) and TASK-009 (#10) as completed
   - Commit all changes on `feat/teamcharter-integration` branch
   - Push branch and create PR (per WFC PR-first workflow)

8. Current Work:
   Wave 4 just completed — both TASK-008 (docs update, agent a45158b) and TASK-009 (integration tests, agent a863fb1) finished successfully:
   - TASK-008: CLAUDE.md and PLANNING.md updated with TEAMCHARTER governance sections, all verification checks passed
   - TASK-009: 17/17 integration tests passing, code formatted and linted
   
   All 9 tasks in the TEAMCHARTER integration plan are now implemented. Task tracker shows tasks #9 and #10 still need to be marked completed.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Mark TASK-008 (#9) and TASK-009 (#10) as completed, run `make format` to fix the 5 files with formatting issues, run the full test suite to verify the complete implementation, then commit all changes and create a PR. This continues the `/wfc-implement full send` command the user explicitly requested — per the WFC PR-first workflow documented in CLAUDE.md: "Build/Plan → Implement → Quality → Review → Push Branch → Create GitHub PR".
