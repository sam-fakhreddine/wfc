Implement the following plan:

# Set Up python-semantic-release (autosemver)

## Context

CLAUDE.md says "Use autosemver for automatic semantic versioning" but it's not implemented. The repo has a `v1.1.0` tag, but `pyproject.toml` still says `version = "0.1.0"`. Two manual release workflows exist (`release.yml`, `publish.yml`) that require manually tagging + keeping pyproject.toml in sync. We'll replace this with automated versioning driven by conventional commits.

## What Changes

### 1. `pyproject.toml` — configure semantic-release + fix version

- Update `version = "0.1.0"` → `version = "1.1.0"` (match existing tag)
- Add `python-semantic-release` to `[project.optional-dependencies] dev`
- Add `[tool.semantic_release]` config:
  - `version_toml = ["pyproject.toml:project.version"]`
  - `branch = "main"`
  - `tag_format = "v{version}"`
  - `commit_message = "chore(release): v{version}"`
  - Changelog generation enabled

### 2. `.github/workflows/release.yml` — rewrite as automated

Replace the manual tag-triggered workflow with:
- Trigger: push to `main`
- Step 1: `semantic-release version` (analyzes commits, bumps version, creates tag)
- Step 2: `semantic-release publish` (creates GitHub release with changelog)
- PyPI publish gated behind `secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN` existence
- Permissions: `contents: write`, `id-token: write`

### 3. `.github/workflows/publish.yml` — delete

Superseded by the automated release.yml.

### 4. `install.sh` line 20 — update VERSION

`VERSION="0.6.0"` → `VERSION="1.1.0"`

## Files to Modify

1. **`pyproject.toml`** — version + semantic-release config
2. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — automated release workflow
3. **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`** — delete
4. **`install.sh`** — sync VERSION constant

## Verification

```bash
# Verify config
uv pip install python-semantic-release
semantic-release version --print
# Should show 1.1.0 (current), no bump needed yet

# After merge to main:
# feat: commit → 1.2.0
# fix: commit → 1.1.1
# BREAKING CHANGE → 2.0.0
```
