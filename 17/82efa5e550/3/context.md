### Prompt 1

we need to work on our token efficiency. every single agent is chewing up 50k token per invocation.

### Prompt 12

Let's get this into develop branch RFN and then reinstall the skills

### Prompt 13

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User said "we need to work on our token efficiency. every single agent is chewing up 50k token per invocation."

2. **My Initial Analysis**: I diagnosed the token bloat problem:
   - Current state: ~14k tokens per reviewer × 5 = 70k tokens per review
   - Main ...
