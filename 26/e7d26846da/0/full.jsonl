ARCHITECTURAL VALIDITY (does this align with project patterns?)\n     - Read the file being commented on\n     - Check if the suggestion follows existing conventions\n     - Consider CLAUDE.md / PLANNING.md rules\n\n  2. SCOPE CHECK (is this in scope for this PR?)\n     - Is it about code IN this PR's diff?\n     - Or is it asking for unrelated refactoring?\n     - Feature requests disguised as review comments → SKIP\n\n  3. CORRECTNESS (is the suggested fix actually right?)\n     - Would implementing it introduce bugs?\n     - Does it handle edge cases the reviewer missed?\n     - Is the reviewer wrong about the issue?\n\n  4. SEVERITY ASSESSMENT\n     - Critical: security, data loss, crashes → always FIX\n     - High: bugs, logic errors → FIX\n     - Medium: code quality, patterns → FIX if valid\n     - Low: style, preferences → FIX if trivial, SKIP if opinionated\n     - Info: questions, suggestions → RESPOND only\n\n  5. EFFORT vs VALUE\n     - Trivial fix (1-2 lines) → always FIX\n     - Medium fix (function-level) → FIX if high value\n     - Large fix (multi-file refactor) → SKIP, create follow-up issue\n\n  Verdict per comment: FIX | SKIP (with reason) | RESPOND (reply only)\n\nStep 4: PRESENT TRIAGE TO USER\n  Show markdown table:\n  | # | File | Comment | Verdict | Reason |\n  |---|------|---------|---------|--------|\n  | 1 | security_hook.py | Add lru_cache | FIX | Valid perf improvement |\n  | 2 | orchestrator.py | Rewrite auth | SKIP | Out of scope |\n  | 3 | README.md | Typo | FIX | Trivial |\n\n  Summary: \"12 FIX, 3 SKIP, 1 RESPOND. Proceed?\"\n  → User approves or adjusts\n\nStep 5: CATEGORIZE & DELEGATE\n  Group FIX comments into categories:\n  - Lint (unused imports, formatting)\n  - Code Quality (caching, error handling, type safety)\n  - Design (architecture, API changes, patterns)\n  - Docs (typos, missing docs, outdated info)\n  - Security (vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets)\n\n  Spawn 1 subagent per category via Task tool (parallel):\n  - Each agent gets: list of comments, file paths, diff context\n  - Each agent: reads file → applies fix → verifies no regressions\n  - Agents run tests relevant to their changes\n\nStep 6: COMMIT & PUSH\n  - Stage all fixed files\n  - Single commit: \"fix: address N PR review comments\"\n  - Body lists each fix briefly\n  - Push to PR branch\n\nStep 7: REPORT\n  - Summary of what was fixed\n  - Summary of what was skipped (with reasons)\n  - Optionally reply to skipped comments on GitHub explaining why\n```\n\n### Subagent Prompt Template\n\nEach fix subagent receives:\n\n```\nYou are fixing PR review comments in category: {category}\n\nComments to address:\n{for each comment:}\n  - File: {path}:{line}\n  - Comment: {body}\n  - Diff context: {diff_hunk}\n{end for}\n\nInstructions:\n1.

Do NOT fix anything not in the comment list\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n1. **Prompt-only skill** — No Python orchestrator. Claude Code follows SKILL.md instructions directly. This is the same pattern as wfc-isthissmart and wfc-build. Simpler, faster to build, easier to maintain.\n\n2. **User approval gate** — Always present triage before fixing. Never auto-fix without confirmation. User can override any verdict.\n\n3. **Single commit** — One commit with all fixes, message lists what was addressed. Matches the pattern we used on PR #4.\n\n4. **`gh` CLI only** — No GitHub API tokens or custom HTTP calls. `gh` handles auth.\n\n5. **Category-based parallelism** — Group by type (lint/quality/design/docs/security), not by file. This lets each agent have focused expertise and avoids conflicts.\n\n---\n\n## Verification\n\n```bash\n# Test with existing PR\n/wfc-pr-comments 4\n\n# Test with auto-detection (on a branch with an open PR)\n/wfc-pr-comments\n\n# Test with URL\n/wfc-pr-comments https://github.com/sam-fakhreddine/wfc/pull/4\n\n# Verify skill validates\nmake validate\n```\n\n---\n\n## Integration\n\n- **Fits after**: `wfc-build` or `wfc-implement` (which create PRs)\n- **Complements**: `wfc-review` (internal review before PR) vs `wfc-pr-comments` (external feedback after PR)\n- **Workflow**: Build → Push PR → Get comments → `/wfc-pr-comments` → Push fixes → Merge\n\n\nIf you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/samfakhreddine/.REDACTED.jsonl"},"uuid":"bf466fe4-2015-4af6-acfb-859af7c9b708","timestamp":"2026-02-13T19:02:49.019Z","planContent":"# wfc-pr-comments — Intelligent PR Comment Triage & Fix Skill\n\n## Context\n\nWhen PRs get review comments (from humans, Copilot, CodeRabbit, etc.), addressing them is currently manual: read each comment, decide if it's valid, categorize, implement fixes, commit, push.

Analysis\n\n## Subject: Rewrite auth system in Rust\n## Verdict: 🟡 PROCEED WITH ADJUSTMENTS\n## Overall Score: 7.5/10\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nOverall, this approach shows 12 clear strengths and 8 areas for consideration.\n\nThe strongest aspects are: Blast Radius, Need, Simplicity.\n\nKey considerations: Opportunity cost of other features, Integration risks, Consider using existing library.\n\nWith an overall score of 7.5/10, this is a solid approach that can move forward with attention to the identified concerns.\n\n---\n\n## Dimension Analysis\n\n### Do We Even Need This? — Score: 8/10\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Addresses clear user need\n- Backed by data/metrics\n\n**Concerns:**\n- Consider if existing solution could be improved instead\n\n**Recommendation:** Need is justified, but validate assumptions\n\n[... 6 more dimensions ...]\n\n---\n\n## Simpler Alternatives\n\n- Start with a simpler MVP and iterate based on feedback\n- Consider using existing solution (e.g., off-the-shelf library)\n- Phase the implementation - deliver core value first\n\n---\n\n## Final Recommendation\n\nProceed, but address these key concerns first: Opportunity cost of other features; Integration risks may extend timeline; Consider using existing library\n```\n\n## Tone\n\n**Discerning but constructive. Honest but not harsh.**\n\nNot a naysayer - wants us to succeed with the best approach. Highlights both strengths and concerns. Suggests simpler alternatives when appropriate.\n\n## Verdict Logic\n\n- **🟢 PROCEED**: Overall score >= 8.5/10, no critical concerns\n- **🟡 PROCEED WITH ADJUSTMENTS**: Score 7.0-8.4, address concerns first\n- **🟠 RECONSIDER**: Score 5.0-6.9, explore alternatives\n- **🔴 DON'T PROCEED**: Score < 5.0 or any dimension <= 4/10\n\n## Integration with WFC\n\n### Can Analyze\n- `wfc-plan` outputs (TASKS.md, PROPERTIES.md)\n- `wfc-architecture` outputs (ARCHITECTURE.md)\n- `wfc-security` outputs (THREAT-MODEL.md)\n- Freeform ideas (text input)\n\n### Produces\n- ISTHISSMART.md report\n- Simpler alternatives\n- Final recommendation\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**ELEGANT**: Simple 7-dimension framework, clear logic\n**MULTI-TIER**: Analysis (logic) separated from presentation\n**PARALLEL**: Can analyze multiple artifacts concurrently\n","numLines":127,"startLine":1,"totalLines":127}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"56fc11a2-da0a-4954-98b2-00f523772874"}

Fetches PR review comments via gh CLI, evaluates each against architectural validity, scope, correctness, and codebase conventions, then fixes valid comments in parallel via subagents. Use when a PR has review comments to address. Triggers on \"address PR comments\", \"fix PR feedback\", \"handle review comments\", or explicit /wfc-pr-comments. Ideal for PRs with multiple review comments from humans or bots (Copilot, CodeRabbit, etc.). Not for creating PRs (use wfc-build) or code review (use wfc-review).\nlicense: MIT\n---\n\n# WFC:PR-COMMENTS - Intelligent PR Comment Triage & Fix\n\n**Fetch, triage, fix.** Automates addressing PR review comments from humans, Copilot, CodeRabbit, and other reviewers.\n\n## What It Does\n\n1. **Fetch** all PR comments via `gh` CLI\n2. **Triage** each comment against 5 validity criteria\n3. **Present** triage summary to user for approval\n4. **Fix** valid comments in parallel (subagents by category)\n5. **Commit & push** fixes to the PR branch\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n# Auto-detect PR from current branch\n/wfc-pr-comments\n\n# Specific PR number\n/wfc-pr-comments 42\n\n# PR URL\n/wfc-pr-comments https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42\n```\n\n---\n\n## Workflow\n\nFollow these steps exactly in order.\n\n### Step 1: DETECT PR\n\nDetermine which PR to work on:\n\n1. If the user provided a PR number or URL as argument, use that.\n2. Otherwise, auto-detect from the current branch:\n\n```bash\ngh pr view --json number,url,headRefName,baseRefName,title\n```\n\nIf no PR is found, tell the user and stop.\n\nDisplay: `PR #N: <title> (<head> -> <base>)`\n\n### Step 2: FETCH COMMENTS\n\nFetch all review comments from the PR. Run these two `gh api` calls:\n\n```bash\n# Inline review comments (comments on specific lines of code)\ngh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments --paginate\n\n# Review-level comments (top-level review bodies)\ngh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews --paginate\n```\n\nExtract from each comment:\n- `id` — unique identifier\n- `user.login` — author\n- `body` — comment text\n- `path` — file being commented on\n- `line` or `original_line` — line number\n- `diff_hunk` — surrounding diff context\n- `created_at` — timestamp\n\n**Deduplication:** If two comments reference the same file + line + substantially identical message, treat them as one.\n\n**Group by file** for display purposes.\n\nIf there are zero comments, tell the user and stop.\n\n### Step 3: TRIAGE\n\nThis is the core intelligence. For each comment, evaluate 5 dimensions and assign a verdict.\n\n**Read each file being commented on** before evaluating (use the Read tool).\n\n#### Dimension 1: ARCHITECTURAL VALIDITY\n\nDoes this suggestion align with project patterns?\n- Check existing conventions in the file and codebase\n- Consider CLAUDE.md / PLANNING.md rules\n- A suggestion that contradicts project conventions → lean toward SKIP\n\n#### Dimension 2: SCOPE CHECK\n\nIs this about code in this PR's diff, or asking for unrelated work?\n- Comment about code changed in this PR → in scope\n- Request for unrelated refactoring → out of scope → SKIP\n- Feature request disguised as review comment → SKIP\n\n#### Dimension 3: CORRECTNESS\n\nIs the suggested fix actually correct?\n- Would implementing it introduce bugs?\n- Does it handle edge cases the reviewer may have missed?\n- Is the reviewer wrong about the issue? If so → SKIP with explanation\n\n#### Dimension 4: SEVERITY\n\n- **Critical** (security, data loss, crashes) → always FIX\n- **High** (bugs, logic errors) → FIX\n- **Medium** (code quality, patterns) → FIX if valid\n- **Low** (style, preferences) → FIX if trivial, SKIP if opinionated\n- **Info** (questions, suggestions) → RESPOND only\n\n#### Dimension 5: EFFORT vs VALUE\n\n- **Trivial** (1-2 lines) → always FIX\n- **Medium** (function-level) → FIX if high value\n- **Large** (multi-file refactor) → SKIP, suggest follow-up issue\n\n**Verdict per comment:** `FIX` | `SKIP (reason)` | `RESPOND (reply only)`\n\n### Step 4: PRESENT TRIAGE TO USER\n\nDisplay a markdown table summarizing the triage:\n\n```\n| # | File | Comment (summary) | Verdict | Reason |\n|---|------|-------------------|---------|--------|\n| 1 | security_hook.py:45 | Add lru_cache to pattern loading | FIX | Valid perf improvement, trivial |\n| 2 | orchestrator.py:120 | Rewrite auth flow | SKIP | Out of scope for this PR |\n| 3 | README.md:8 | Fix typo \"teh\" → \"the\" | FIX | Trivial |\n| 4 | consensus.py:30 | Why not use dataclass? | RESPOND | Question, not actionable |\n```\n\nThen show summary counts:\n\n```\nSummary: 8 FIX, 2 SKIP, 1 RESPOND\n\nProceed with fixes?\n```\n\n**Use AskUserQuestion** to get approval. The user may:\n- Approve as-is\n- Override specific verdicts (e.g., \"skip #1, fix #4\")\n- Cancel entirely\n\nApply any user overrides before proceeding.\n\n### Step 5: CATEGORIZE & DELEGATE\n\nGroup all `FIX` comments into categories:\n\n| Category | Examples |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Lint** | Unused imports, formatting, naming conventions |\n| **Code Quality** | Caching, error handling, type safety, simplification |\n| **Design** | Architecture changes, API modifications, patterns |\n| **Docs** | Typos, missing docs, outdated comments |\n| **Security** | Vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, input validation |\n\nSpawn **1 subagent per category** via the Task tool (run in parallel).\n\nEach subagent receives this prompt:\n\n```\nYou are fixing PR review comments in category: {category}\n\nPR: #{number} on branch {headRefName}\nRepository root: {repo_root}\n\nComments to address:\n{for each comment in this category:}\n---\nFile: {path}:{line}\nComment by {author}: {body}\nDiff context:\n{diff_hunk}\n---\n{end for}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read each file mentioned above\n2. Apply the fix described in each comment\n3. Verify the fix is correct — do not introduce regressions\n4. Run relevant tests if they exist (use: uv run pytest {test_file} -v)\n5. Do NOT fix anything not in the comment list above\n6. Do NOT make unrelated improvements or refactors\n```\n\nFor `RESPOND` comments: Do NOT spawn a subagent. Instead, after fixes are committed, use `gh api` to reply to the comment on GitHub with an explanation.\n\n### Step 6: COMMIT & PUSH\n\nAfter all fix subagents complete:\n\n1. Check which files were modified: `git status`\n2. Stage all fixed files (by name, not `git add -A`)\n3. Create a single commit:\n\n```\nfix: address N PR review comments\n\n- {file1}: {brief description of fix}\n- {file2}: {brief description of fix}\n...\n\nAddresses comments on PR #{number}\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n```\n\n4.

Fetches PR review comments via gh CLI, evaluates each against architectural validity, scope, correctness, and codebase conventions, then fixes valid comments in parallel via subagents. Use when a PR has review comments to address. Triggers on \"address PR comments\", \"fix PR feedback\", \"handle review comments\", or explicit /wfc-pr-comments. Ideal for PRs with multiple review comments from humans or bots (Copilot, CodeRabbit, etc.). Not for creating PRs (use wfc-build) or code review (use wfc-review).\nlicense: MIT\n---\n\n# WFC:PR-COMMENTS - Intelligent PR Comment Triage & Fix\n\n**Fetch, triage, fix.** Automates addressing PR review comments from humans, Copilot, CodeRabbit, and other reviewers.\n\n## What It Does\n\n1. **Fetch** all PR comments via `gh` CLI\n2. **Triage** each comment against 5 validity criteria\n3. **Present** triage summary to user for approval\n4. **Fix** valid comments in parallel (subagents by category)\n5. **Commit & push** fixes to the PR branch\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n# Auto-detect PR from current branch\n/wfc-pr-comments\n\n# Specific PR number\n/wfc-pr-comments 42\n\n# PR URL\n/wfc-pr-comments https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42\n```\n\n---\n\n## Workflow\n\nFollow these steps exactly in order.\n\n### Step 1: DETECT PR\n\nDetermine which PR to work on:\n\n1. If the user provided a PR number or URL as argument, use that.\n2. Otherwise, auto-detect from the current branch:\n\n```bash\ngh pr view --json number,url,headRefName,baseRefName,title\n```\n\nIf no PR is found, tell the user and stop.\n\nDisplay: `PR #N: <title> (<head> -> <base>)`\n\n### Step 2: FETCH COMMENTS\n\nFetch all review comments from the PR. Run these two `gh api` calls:\n\n```bash\n# Inline review comments (comments on specific lines of code)\ngh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments --paginate\n\n# Review-level comments (top-level review bodies)\ngh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews --paginate\n```\n\nExtract from each comment:\n- `id` — unique identifier\n- `user.login` — author\n- `body` — comment text\n- `path` — file being commented on\n- `line` or `original_line` — line number\n- `diff_hunk` — surrounding diff context\n- `created_at` — timestamp\n\n**Deduplication:** If two comments reference the same file + line + substantially identical message, treat them as one.\n\n**Group by file** for display purposes.\n\nIf there are zero comments, tell the user and stop.\n\n### Step 3: TRIAGE\n\nThis is the core intelligence. For each comment, evaluate 5 dimensions and assign a verdict.\n\n**Read each file being commented on** before evaluating (use the Read tool).\n\n#### Dimension 1: ARCHITECTURAL VALIDITY\n\nDoes this suggestion align with project patterns?\n- Check existing conventions in the file and codebase\n- Consider CLAUDE.md / PLANNING.md rules\n- A suggestion that contradicts project conventions → lean toward SKIP\n\n#### Dimension 2: SCOPE CHECK\n\nIs this about code in this PR's diff, or asking for unrelated work?\n- Comment about code changed in this PR → in scope\n- Request for unrelated refactoring → out of scope → SKIP\n- Feature request disguised as review comment → SKIP\n\n#### Dimension 3: CORRECTNESS\n\nIs the suggested fix actually correct?\n- Would implementing it introduce bugs?\n- Does it handle edge cases the reviewer may have missed?\n- Is the reviewer wrong about the issue? If so → SKIP with explanation\n\n#### Dimension 4: SEVERITY\n\n- **Critical** (security, data loss, crashes) → always FIX\n- **High** (bugs, logic errors) → FIX\n- **Medium** (code quality, patterns) → FIX if valid\n- **Low** (style, preferences) → FIX if trivial, SKIP if opinionated\n- **Info** (questions, suggestions) → RESPOND only\n\n#### Dimension 5: EFFORT vs VALUE\n\n- **Trivial** (1-2 lines) → always FIX\n- **Medium** (function-level) → FIX if high value\n- **Large** (multi-file refactor) → SKIP, suggest follow-up issue\n\n**Verdict per comment:** `FIX` | `SKIP (reason)` | `RESPOND (reply only)`\n\n### Step 4: PRESENT TRIAGE TO USER\n\nDisplay a markdown table summarizing the triage:\n\n```\n| # | File | Comment (summary) | Verdict | Reason |\n|---|------|-------------------|---------|--------|\n| 1 | security_hook.py:45 | Add lru_cache to pattern loading | FIX | Valid perf improvement, trivial |\n| 2 | orchestrator.py:120 | Rewrite auth flow | SKIP | Out of scope for this PR |\n| 3 | README.md:8 | Fix typo \"teh\" → \"the\" | FIX | Trivial |\n| 4 | consensus.py:30 | Why not use dataclass? | RESPOND | Question, not actionable |\n```\n\nThen show summary counts:\n\n```\nSummary: 8 FIX, 2 SKIP, 1 RESPOND\n\nProceed with fixes?\n```\n\n**Use AskUserQuestion** to get approval. The user may:\n- Approve as-is\n- Override specific verdicts (e.g., \"skip #1, fix #4\")\n- Cancel entirely\n\nApply any user overrides before proceeding.\n\n### Step 5: CATEGORIZE & DELEGATE\n\nGroup all `FIX` comments into categories:\n\n| Category | Examples |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Lint** | Unused imports, formatting, naming conventions |\n| **Code Quality** | Caching, error handling, type safety, simplification |\n| **Design** | Architecture changes, API modifications, patterns |\n| **Docs** | Typos, missing docs, outdated comments |\n| **Security** | Vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, input validation |\n\nSpawn **1 subagent per category** via the Task tool (run in parallel).\n\nEach subagent receives this prompt:\n\n```\nYou are fixing PR review comments in category: {category}\n\nPR: #{number} on branch {headRefName}\nRepository root: {repo_root}\n\nComments to address:\n{for each comment in this category:}\n---\nFile: {path}:{line}\nComment by {author}: {body}\nDiff context:\n{diff_hunk}\n---\n{end for}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read each file mentioned above\n2. Apply the fix described in each comment\n3. Verify the fix is correct — do not introduce regressions\n4. Run relevant tests if they exist (use: uv run pytest {test_file} -v)\n5. Do NOT fix anything not in the comment list above\n6. Do NOT make unrelated improvements or refactors\n```\n\nFor `RESPOND` comments: Do NOT spawn a subagent. Instead, after fixes are committed, use `gh api` to reply to the comment on GitHub with an explanation.\n\n### Step 6: COMMIT & PUSH\n\nAfter all fix subagents complete:\n\n1. Check which files were modified: `git status`\n2. Stage all fixed files (by name, not `git add -A`)\n3. Create a single commit:\n\n```\nfix: address N PR review comments\n\n- {file1}: {brief description of fix}\n- {file2}: {brief description of fix}\n...\n\nAddresses comments on PR #{number}\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n```\n\n4. Push to the PR branch:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin {headRefName}\n```\n\n### Step 7: REPORT\n\nDisplay a final summary:\n\n```\n## PR Comment Fixes Complete\n\n**PR:** #{number} — {title}\n**Branch:** {headRefName}\n\n### Fixed (N comments)\n- {file}:{line} — {brief fix description}\n- ...\n\n### Skipped (N comments)\n- {file}:{line} — {reason}\n- ...\n\n### Responded (N comments)\n- {file}:{line} — {reply summary}\n- ...\n\nPushed to {headRefName}.

Quick adaptive interview (3-5 questions)\n2. Orchestrator assesses complexity (1 agent or N agents)\n3. Subagent(s) implement via TDD in isolated worktrees\n4. Quality checks (formatters, linters, tests)\n5. Consensus review (wfc-review with 5 expert personas)\n6.

UNDERSTAND\n   - Read orchestrator's task spec\n   - Review related files\n   - Understand context\n\n2. TEST_FIRST (RED)\n   - Write tests BEFORE code\n   - Run tests → FAIL\n\n3. IMPLEMENT (GREEN)\n   - Write minimum code to pass\n   - Run tests → PASS\n\n4. REFACTOR\n   - Clean up code\n   - Run tests → still PASS\n\n5. QUALITY_CHECK\n   - Run formatters (black, prettier, etc.)\n   - Run linters (ruff, eslint, etc.)\n   - Run tests\n   - Blocks if checks fail\n\n6.

Slash command name?\n2. **Input** - What does it receive?\n3. **Output** - What does it produce?\n4. **Agents** - Multi-agent or single-agent?\n5. **Integration** - Which WFC skills does it integrate with?\n6. **Configuration** - What's configurable?\n7. **Telemetry** - What should be tracked?\n8. **Properties** - Any formal properties?\n\n## Output\n\n### Generated Prompt ({skill-name}-prompt.md)\n\nComplete Claude Code agentic prompt following WFC patterns:\n- YAML front matter (name, description, user-invocable)\n- Purpose and usage\n- Inputs/outputs\n- Integration points\n- Configuration schema\n- Telemetry specification\n- ELEGANT/MULTI-TIER/PARALLEL philosophy\n\n### Optional: Auto-Build\n\nWhen `--build` flag is used:\n1. Feeds prompt into `wfc-plan` → generates TASKS.md\n2. Feeds TASKS.md into `wfc-implement` → builds the skill\n3. Registers new skill as working slash command\n\n## Meta-Recursive Magic\n\nWFC can build itself:\n\n```bash\n# Build a new skill to analyze database schemas\n/wfc-newskill --build\n> What should this skill do?\n> \"Analyze database schema and generate data models\"\n\n[Interview...]\n\n[Auto-build using wfc-plan → wfc-implement...]\n\n# New skill is ready\n/wfc-db-schema path/to/schema.sql\n```\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**ELEGANT**: Simple interview, template-based generation\n**MULTI-TIER**: Interview → Generation → Build (clean layers)\n**PARALLEL**: Meta-recursive (builds itself)\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":2,"oldLines":9,"newStart":2,"newLines":6,"lines":[" name: wfc-newskill"," description: Meta-skill for creating new WFC skills.

It's friction that adds zero safety value.

Let me check the GitHub API to understand how to filter for unresolved comments.\n\nIn GitHub's API, review comments don't have a direct \"resolved/unresolved\" field in the basic comments endpoint. However, pull request review comments that are part of a review thread can be checked via the GraphQL API or by checking the `pull_request_review_id` and cross-referencing with review state.\n\nActually, the better approach is to use the GraphQL API which has `isResolved` on review threads, or use `gh api` with the REST API for pull request review comments and filter by looking at whether they're part of a resolved thread.\n\n\nThe resolution status lives at the review thread level rather than on individual comments, so I need to switch to GraphQL to query `pullRequest.reviewThreads` and filter by the `isResolved` field to get only the unresolved ones. I'll update the SKILL.md to use this GraphQL approach instead.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":48,"cache_read_input_tokens":71620,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":48,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":11,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY6bsJtUdBkHkraQaJBCG","type":"assistant","uuid":"dfeeea91-7439-4e79-a5ef-1679df69b704","timestamp":"2026-02-13T19:14:35.598Z"}

For each comment, evaluate 5 dimensions and assign a verdict.\n\n**Read each file being commented on** before evaluating (use the Read tool).\n\n#### Dimension 1: ARCHITECTURAL VALIDITY\n\nDoes this suggestion align with project patterns?\n- Check existing conventions in the file and codebase\n- Consider CLAUDE.md / PLANNING.md rules\n- A suggestion that contradicts project conventions → lean toward SKIP\n\n#### Dimension 2: SCOPE CHECK\n\nIs this about code in this PR's diff, or asking for unrelated work?\n- Comment about code changed in this PR → in scope\n- Request for unrelated refactoring → out of scope → SKIP\n- Feature request disguised as review comment → SKIP\n\n#### Dimension 3: CORRECTNESS\n\nIs the suggested fix actually correct?\n- Would implementing it introduce bugs?\n- Does it handle edge cases the reviewer may have missed?\n- Is the reviewer wrong about the issue? If so → SKIP with explanation\n\n#### Dimension 4: SEVERITY\n\n- **Critical** (security, data loss, crashes) → always FIX\n- **High** (bugs, logic errors) → FIX\n- **Medium** (code quality, patterns) → FIX if valid\n- **Low** (style, preferences) → FIX if trivial, SKIP if opinionated\n- **Info** (questions, suggestions) → RESPOND only\n\n#### Dimension 5: EFFORT vs VALUE\n\n- **Trivial** (1-2 lines) → always FIX\n- **Medium** (function-level) → FIX if high value\n- **Large** (multi-file refactor) → SKIP, suggest follow-up issue\n\n**Verdict per comment:** `FIX` | `SKIP (reason)` | `RESPOND (reply only)`\n\n### Step 4: PRESENT TRIAGE TO USER\n\nDisplay a markdown table summarizing the triage:\n\n```\n| # | File | Comment (summary) | Verdict | Reason |\n|---|------|-------------------|---------|--------|\n| 1 | security_hook.py:45 | Add lru_cache to pattern loading | FIX | Valid perf improvement, trivial |\n| 2 | orchestrator.py:120 | Rewrite auth flow | SKIP | Out of scope for this PR |\n| 3 | README.md:8 | Fix typo \"teh\" → \"the\" | FIX | Trivial |\n| 4 | consensus.py:30 | Why not use dataclass? | RESPOND | Question, not actionable |\n```\n\nThen show summary counts:\n\n```\nSummary: 8 FIX, 2 SKIP, 1 RESPOND\n\nProceed with fixes?\n```\n\n**Use AskUserQuestion** to get approval. The user may:\n- Approve as-is\n- Override specific verdicts (e.g., \"skip #1, fix #4\")\n- Cancel entirely\n\nApply any user overrides before proceeding.\n\n### Step 5: CATEGORIZE & DELEGATE\n\nGroup all `FIX` comments into categories:\n\n| Category | Examples |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Lint** | Unused imports, formatting, naming conventions |\n| **Code Quality** | Caching, error handling, type safety, simplification |\n| **Design** | Architecture changes, API modifications, patterns |\n| **Docs** | Typos, missing docs, outdated comments |\n| **Security** | Vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, input validation |\n\nSpawn **1 subagent per category** via the Task tool (run in parallel).\n\nEach subagent receives this prompt:\n\n```\nYou are fixing PR review comments in category: {category}\n\nPR: #{number} on branch {headRefName}\nRepository root: {repo_root}\n\nComments to address:\n{for each comment in this category:}\n---\nFile: {path}:{line}\nComment by {author}: {body}\nDiff context:\n{diff_hunk}\n---\n{end for}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read each file mentioned above\n2. Apply the fix described in each comment\n3. Verify the fix is correct — do not introduce regressions\n4. Run relevant tests if they exist (use: uv run pytest {test_file} -v)\n5. Do NOT fix anything not in the comment list above\n6. Do NOT make unrelated improvements or refactors\n```\n\nFor `RESPOND` comments: Do NOT spawn a subagent. Instead, after fixes are committed, use `gh api` to reply to the comment on GitHub with an explanation.\n\n### Step 6: COMMIT & PUSH\n\nAfter all fix subagents complete:\n\n1. Check which files were modified: `git status`\n2. Stage all fixed files (by name, not `git add -A`)\n3. Create a single commit:\n\n```\nfix: address N PR review comments\n\n- {file1}: {brief description of fix}\n- {file2}: {brief description of fix}\n...\n\nAddresses comments on PR #{number}\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n```\n\n4. Push to the PR branch:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin {headRefName}\n```\n\n### Step 7: REPORT\n\nDisplay a final summary:\n\n```\n## PR Comment Fixes Complete\n\n**PR:** #{number} — {title}\n**Branch:** {headRefName}\n\n### Fixed (N comments)\n- {file}:{line} — {brief fix description}\n- ...\n\n### Skipped (N comments)\n- {file}:{line} — {reason}\n- ...\n\n### Responded (N comments)\n- {file}:{line} — {reply summary}\n- ...\n\nPushed to {headRefName}. PR updated.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Integration with WFC\n\n### Fits After\n- `wfc-build` or `wfc-implement` (which create PRs)\n- Any workflow that pushes a branch and creates a PR\n\n### Complements\n- `wfc-review` — internal review BEFORE creating a PR\n- `wfc-pr-comments` — external feedback AFTER PR is created\n\n### Typical Flow\n```\nwfc-build → Push PR → Reviewers comment → /wfc-pr-comments → Push fixes → Merge\n```\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**ELEGANT:** Single skill replaces manual comment-by-comment triage\n**PARALLEL:** Fix subagents run concurrently by category\n**TOKEN-AWARE:** Only reads files that have comments, not the entire codebase\n**SAFE:** User approval gate before any fixes are applied\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":50,"oldLines":32,"newStart":50,"newLines":60,"lines":[" "," Display: `PR #N: <title> (<head> -> <base>)`"," ","-### Step 2: FETCH COMMENTS","+### Step 2: FETCH UNRESOLVED COMMENTS"," ","-Fetch all review comments from the PR.
