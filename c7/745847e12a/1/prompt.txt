ok I run wfc local and this is the development code.
I want to remove the "installed" version of wfc without losing my development data because I want to get to the version we have in `main` right now. Understood?

---

what do you mean unstaged?

---

.development should move to ~/.wfc/development (thats the new pattern)
same with test-results and validation
and then we deep dive on docs and skills

---

yes nothing lost just moved

---

tell me what is unstaged and why

---

ok lets drop anything that is duplicated.
and lets compare to what is in main right now because I merged a large PR an hour ago

---

gonna need to rbanch because you cant push to main but #1
